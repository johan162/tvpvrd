README FOR MANPAGES

This folder contains all manpages defined for the tvpvrd package.
The manpages are written in Docbook XML format and then transformed via 'xsltproc'
to the proper Unix nroff man page format. The reason not to write them originally
in nroff format is simply that having them in Docbook makes it easy to produce other 
formats as well, for example (X)HTML and PDF.

The trivial Makefile have three targets

make all (or just make)
    Will build the nroff pages suitable for use with the man command and
    the HTML version of the man pages.
    
make pdf
    Will build the PDF versions of the man pages.
