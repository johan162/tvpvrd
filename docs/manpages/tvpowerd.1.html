                completely different physical server. The reason is that this daemon monitors the
                server doing the TV-recording and turns the power to the recording server on and off
                according to the recording schedule. This will allow the tv-recording server to act
                as a faithful imitation of a real VCR (or Digital PVR). This is good solution if you
                normally have one server that is constantly running (such as you mail- or file
                server) where this daemon can run (it takes virtually no extra CPU and a very small
                memory footprint). The media server doing the recording is often located somewhere
                else , perhaps in the TV-room, and it is desirable to both have it quiet when it is
                not recording as well as saving on the planets energy.</p><p>In order for this to work there are a few, but vital, pre-conditions that must be

                root user. As soon as the server doesn't need root privileges it will switch to run
                as the user specified in the ini-file, by default this is the user
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>tvpowerd</em></span>. This user should for security reasons not be the
                'root' user. This user should be a system user without login shell. Such a user can
                normally be created by running the command '<span class="emphasis"><em>useradd</em></span>'. (If the
                server is installed via the RPM package this user will be automatically
                created)</p><pre class="screen">$&gt; useradd -r tvpowerd</pre><p>To start the server as root the simplest way is to just call</p><pre class="screen">$root&gt; tvpowerd</pre><p>In order to stop the server and allow it to do a clean shutdown the
                    <code class="code">SIGHUP</code> (or <code class="code">SIGSTOP</code>) signal should be sent to the
                process running the server (assuming tvpvrd has been started as a daemon). The
                distribution includes two support scripts to help with this. </p><p>The first script will be automatically installed in
                    "<code class="filename">/etc/init.d/tvpvrd</code>" and follows the normal guidelines for
                a "<code class="filename">init.d</code>" service start/stopping script according to LSB
                (Linux Standard Base). Using this script to start the server the command</p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/tvpowerd start</pre><p>is given and to stop the server the command</p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/tvpowerd stop</pre><p>should be given. The startup script also supports the "restart" and "status"
                options. </p><p>Finally if for some reason you don't want to use any of these scripts it is
                possible to manually kill the daemon process by sending the SIGHUP signal via the
                    '<span class="emphasis"><em>kill</em></span>'command as</p><pre class="screen">$&gt; kill -SIGHUP &lt;pid&gt;</pre><p>where &lt;pid&gt; is the process id of the <span class="emphasis"><em>tvpowerd</em></span> daemon. Use
                'ps xa' to find the pid or if the server was started as root look in the file
                    '<code class="filename">/var/run/tvpowerd.pid</code>' </p><p>If the server gives the error message : "<span class="emphasis"><em>Server can not be started. See
                    system log</em></span>" then more information about the details of the problem
                can be found in the system log, normally <code class="filename">/var/log/messages</code>. One
                common issue might be a stale lock file (in
                    <code class="filename">/var/run/tvpowerd.pid</code>) in case the server is not started
                from the root user. The reason is that in order to write these lock files the server
                must run as a root. Since normally the server only runs as a root at the startup
                phase (and then switches over to the selected user) the lock/pid file cannot be
                removed. This is not a problem if the server is again started as root but if the
                server is started from the command line as a non-root user it will complain that the
                lock file already exists. The solution in this case is to manually remove the
                lockfile (as root).</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="How to shutdown the remote server"><a name="idp149936"></a><h2>How to shutdown the remote server</h2><p>The specific way to shutdown the remote recording server can be specified in the
                configuration file. By default the server will be shutdown via a standard call to
                    <span class="command"><strong>shutdonw</strong></span>
                <span class="italic">-h &lt;time&gt;</span> command. </p><p>A variant of this is to put the recording server in suspend or hibernation mode.
                Most reasonable modern computers will support this way of energy saving.
                Unfortunately the ivtv driver (that controls the TV-card) is not aware of power
                management which means that it will not survive a suspend-wakeup cycle. In order for
                the driver to work it must firs be unloaded before the server is shut down and then
                reloaded when the server is started up. The driver load/unload will be handled
                automatically if the unload_driver variable is set as</p><p>
                </p><pre class="screen">unload_driver=yes</pre><p>
            </p><p>in the configuration file.</p><p>Note 1: If you decide to use suspend/resume it is probably best to try the
                commands manually first to make sure it works as expected.</p><p>Note 2: The suspend/hibernate shutdown method should still be regarded as
                experimental since experience shows that depending on hardware and system
                configuration this is not always 100% reliable. On some hardware/system
                configurations it has been reported that after a suspend a driver unload/load cycle
                is still no sufficient to make the driver work again. On yet other HW it has been
                reported that the daemon does no longer respond after a suspend/wakeup cycle. If
                yoiu experince these problems please use the default shutdown method.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="When will the daemon shutdown the remote server?"><a name="idp156112"></a><h2>When will the daemon shutdown the remote server?</h2><p>The daemon follows a number of strict rules when it will and when it wont shutdown
                the remote server. The daemon will only shutdown the recording server it the
                following conditions are satisfied:</p><p>

                            file (default is 0.5). This helps prevent shutdown if the user has

            </p><p>Tip: In order to manually force a wakeup the daemon will look for a an (empty)
