                more installed TV-Capture cards and, following a specified schedule, will record
                broadcasted and encoded streams from the capture card to disk. In affect a digital
                version of a programmable VHS.</para>
            <para>The original stored HW encoded file (from the capture card) can then be
                automatically transcoded (using <citerefentry>

                initial HW encoder settings as well as the transcoding options are bundled in a
                'profile'. </para>
            <para>Each recording is done using one (or multiple) profiles. Each recording will
                always have at least one profile, the primary profile. In this way it is possible to
                create multiple transcoded versions of one recording, for example one high quality
                version for viewing on a computer and one low quality versions for viewing on a
                mobile device. By default the distribution includes four profiles 'high', 'normal',
                'low', 'mobile'. Additional profiles can easily be added by the user. A profile is
                specified in the traditional ini-file text file format and is stored under the
                'profiles' directory which is a subdirectory to the settings directory (normally
                    <filename>/etc/tvpvrd</filename>). Each setting in the profile is well
                documented in the profiles. The settings are also described in <citerefentry>

                running '<emphasis>tvpvrd</emphasis>' via a dedicated port (by default 9300). The
                server is controlled via a simple (but efficient) command language which allows
                manipulation of future recordings and various other administrative tasks. All
                commands are extensively described in the section 'Command language' below. </para>

                as the user specified in the ini-file, by default this is the user
                    <emphasis>tvpvrd</emphasis>. This user should for security reasons not be the
                'root' user. This user should be a system user without login shell. Such a user can
                normally be created by running the command '<emphasis>useradd</emphasis>'. (If the
                server is installed via the RPM package this user will be automatically
                created)</para>

            </para>
            <para>In order to stop the server and allow it to do a clean shutdown the SIGHUP (or
                SIGSTOP) signal should be sent to the process running the server (assuming tvpvrd
                has been started as a daemon). The distribution includes a simple script
                'stop-tvpvrd' which will read the server pid from
                    '<filename>/var/run/tvpvrd.pid</filename>' and send the SIGHUP signal.</para>

                <screen>$> kill -SIGHUP &lt;pid></screen>
            </para>
            <para>where &lt;pid> is the process id of the <emphasis>tvpvrd</emphasis> daemon. Use
                'ps xa' to find the pid or if the server was started as root look in the file
                    '<filename>/var/run/tvpvrd.pid</filename>' </para>
            <para>When the server is shutdown the DB will be updated and depending on the "Kill
                transcoding flag" (see the <option>-ktf</option> command) any on-going transcodings
                will be shutdown. Any potential ongoing recordings will be aborted and the
                recordings up to the time the recording is shutdown will be left in the
                    '<filename>&lt;data-dir>/vtmp</filename>' directory and must be removed
                manually.</para>
            <para>Hint: If the server gives the error message : "Server can not be started. See
                system log" then more information about the details of the problem can be found in
                the system log, normally <filename>/var/log/messages</filename>. One common issue
                might be stale lock files (in <filename>/var/run/tvpvrd.pid</filename>). This is a
                result of the fact that in order to write these lock files the server must run as a
                root. Since normally the server only runs as a root at the startup phase (and then
                switches over to the selected user) the lock/pid file cannot be removed. This is not
                a problem is the server is again started as root but if the server is started from
                the command line as a non-root user it will complain that the lock file already
                exists. The solution in this case is to manually remove the lockfile (as
                root).</para>

            <title>Running as master or slave</title>
            <para>Normally the daemon will do necessary checks to verify that one or several video
                cards are present in order to startup. If no video cards are found the server will
                print an error message and terminate. However it is still possible to run the daemon
                on a server with no video cards by running the server in <emphasis
                    role="italic">slave</emphasis> mode. This will restrict the functionality of the
                server to only transcoding and status information commands.</para>
            <para>The primary purpose of running the server in slave configuration is to make it
                possible to use several servers to transcode video files. There are three commands "<emphasis
                    role="bold">tf</emphasis>" (<emphasis
                    role="italic">transcode file</emphasis>), "<emphasis
                    role="bold">tl</emphasis>" (<emphasis
                    role="italic">transcode list</emphasis>) and "<emphasis
                    role="bold">td</emphasis>" (<emphasis
                    role="italic">transcode directory</emphasis>) that can be used to transcode one
                or more files in slave mode (see the command section below for details).</para>
            <para>In future version of the server there will be possibility to configure a load
                balancing setup among several servers for the transcoding but as of version 1.x this
                has to be done manually.</para>
            <para>The server can be run in slave mode by either giving the "<option>-s</option>"
                option when starting the server or by setting the configuration alternative
                    "<option>master=no</option>" in the configuration file.</para>

            <title>Connecting to the server</title>
            <para>Once the server is running the easiest way to connect to the server is by using
                the '<emphasis>telnet</emphasis>' program. Assuming that the
                    <emphasis>tvpvrd</emphasis> server is running on the localhost the following
                command will connect to the server (assuming the default port 9300 has not been

            <title>The recording and transcoding process</title>
            <para>The recording process refers to the process of saving the generated MP2 video
                stream from the capture card to a file.</para>
            <para>The transcoding process refers to the re-coding of the original MP2 video stream
                to a more efficient format, usually an MP4 container using H.264 video codec (the
                default in the distributed profiles). Depending on the quality settings it is common
                to see reduction in original file size with 75%</para>
            <para>Unfortunately the transcoding process is extremely CPU-intensive and with the
                default settings in the distribution the normal profile will require roughly 1.5
                times to transcode as the original play time on a high end machine (as of 2009) . In
                order not to make the machine totally unresponsive the ini-file specifies a maximum
                load for a transcoding to start in order not to load the server with too many
                parallel transcoding processes. If the load is too high the transcoding processes
                will be put in a queue waiting for the load to become acceptable.</para>
            <para>Each transcoding is run as its own process with a 'nice' value of 20. </para>
            <para>When a recording is started a temporary directory will be created under
                    '<filename>&lt;data-dir>/vtmp/vid&lt;n>/</filename>' where &lt;n> is the number
                of the video card used. The name of the temporary directory will be the same as the
                base name of the recording. The MPEG stream is read from the video card and stored
                in a file in the temporary directory with the same name as the title (converted to
                lower case) with the suffix ".mpg".</para>
            <para>The hardware capture card settings to be used (bitrate, frame size etc.) is read
                from the primary profile (i.e. the first profile if multiple profiles are
                specified).</para>
            <para>When the recording has stopped the transcoding profile(s) is read and the
                transcoding is started after a check that the server load is not higher than the
                maximum allowed load in order to start a transcoding. If the load is too high the
                transcoding is put in a queue of waiting transcodings that will be started when the
                server load allows the transcoding to start. One transcoding will be made for each
                of the associated profiles of this recording.</para>
            <para>As a special case no transcoding will be made if the '<emphasis>ffmpeg</emphasis>'
                profile bitrate is set to 0 Mbps in the profile. In this case only the original MP2
                video file will be kept.</para>
            <para>Once a transcoding has finished the resulting MP4 file will be moved to the
                directory '<filename>&lt;data-dir>/mp4/&lt;profile>/</filename>' with the same file
                basename as the title but with the filename suffix ".mp4".</para>
            <para>When all the transcodings have been done and if the profile defines that the
                original MP2 video stream should be kept it is moved to the directory
                    '<filename>&lt;data-dir>/mp2/</filename>'. After that the temporary directory
                (and the original MP2 file) is deleted.</para>
            <para>Another possibility is to do the recording first and later decide to transcode one
                or several video files. This is done by giving a separate transcode command to the
                server and specify the full file path to the file to be transcoded. In order to make
                this as convenient as possible there are three variants of this. One variant is to
                transcode one video file, the other is to specify a directory where all the files
                will be transcoded. The final way is to store a number of video file names in a text
                file and use that text file as an input list of the files to transcode. See the
                command description below for the commands "<option>tf</option>",
                    "<option>td</option>" and "<option>tl</option>".</para>

            <title>Stations, channels and frequencies</title>
            <para>All TV stations are broadcasted on a local unique frequency. The frequency
                spectrum is divided in internationally standardized fixed width channels. A channel
                is the same as a specified frequency. The distance between each assigned frequency
                is different depending on both the frequency area and the TV standard used. This
                depends on the fact that different TV standard requires different bandwidth. This
                channel division is also different depending on the geographic location. </para>
            <para>It is important to realize that these fixed frequencies are assigned according to
                international standards. In each city (and city area) the broadcasting company is
                then responsible for assigning local stations to appropriate frequency channels.
                This is the difference between station and channel names. The channel names have
                short names with 2 to 5 characters, for example 'SE14'. Even though the frequency
                division is standardized the exact channel names are not always given with the
                assigned names. For example a broadcasting company might claim (for example on their
                home page) that the station 'BBC1' in a certain area can be found on channel '14'
                when they actually should have said that the station can be found on channel 'SE14'
                which is the official name of this channel.</para>

                frequency maps. The program has built in knowledge of the frequency channels

                yast2 configuration tool. The result of this channel scan is usually stored in a

                home directory, usually as '<filename>~/.awtvrc</filename>'. Of course even if the

                            <para>The fist set of information gives general information about the
                                chosen file list. The last line of the first information block gives
                                a rough estimate of the remaining time left needed to transcode the
                                list. This is a very approximate estimation based on the time it has
                                taken to transcode the files in the list up to now. In the example
                                above the estimate is shown as -1 indicating that there are too few
                                completed transcodings for any estimate to be done. At least 2
                                transcoding must have been completed in order for the estimate to be
                                shown.</para>

                                been completely transcoded or is in the process of being

                        backs off and waits a (random) time until it tries to see if it can start
                        the transcoding (when the server load is below the set threshold).</para>
