$Id$

This directory contains a very basic shell program which connects to the tvpvrd daemon using the
TCP/IP port specified in the config file for tvpvrd.

Using this shell it is possible to create a specific user on the server and then
use this program as the shell for that user. In that way it is possible to connect
to the daemon by logging in to the server using for example ssh, as a normal user.

The password handling will then be controlled by the normal Unix password as specified
in /etc/passwd

See INSTALL for more details.
