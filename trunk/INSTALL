Installation Instructions for tvpvrd
====================================

**************************** IMPORTANT ! *****************************************
See bottom of page (Installing From Repository) for extra steps if you have 
downloaded  directly from the subversion repository. This requires some autotools 
setup. If you are not comfortable with this please use the prepared tar-ball.
**********************************************************************************

Quick installation using the tar-ball-package
=============================================

For the impatient:
Step 0.
-------
$ tar xJf tvpvrd-<version>.tar.xz

Step 1.
-------
$ cd tvpvrd-<version>
$ ./configure && make -j4

Step 2. 
-------
$ sudo make install

The above will run the configure script with the most common installation
directories on modern system as well as do a reasonable silent build.
The daemon will be installed under /usr/bin and the config files under
/etc/tvpvrd

The next step is to make some (minimal) adjustments in the configuration file
to adapt to your server setup.

Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile and install this package is:

  0. Unpack the tarball

     $ tar xJf tvpvrd-<versions>.tar.xz

     Where <version> is replaced by the current version number.

  1. Switch to the created directory

     $ cd tvpvrd-<version>

  2. Configure and build the source

     $ ./configure && make -j4

     If there are some error messages it is mot likely due to missing
     libraries that is needed to build the daemon. The error message
     will give more information on what library should be installed.
     
  3. Install the daemon

     $ sudo make install

     Update the configuration file to match your system. At minimum you
     need to specify what directory should be used to store the 
     recordings.  Start with either the simplified or complete 
     template config file available in "/etc/tvpvrd" and rename that
     template "tvpvrd.conf". 

  4. After installation you may remove the newly created directory.

  5. Now start the daemon.

     On debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint type: 

     	$ sudo start tvpvrd

     On OpenSuSE type: 

     	$ /etc/init.s/tvpvrd start
   

Using mod_proxy in apache Web-server to access the Web interface
================================================================

Normally the Web interface is accessed by connecting to the host where
the daemon is installed on port 9301 (one more than the port for the
command interface). For example if the server is installed on the
localhost the URL

http://localhost:9301/

would connect to the daemon Web-interface (assuming it is eanbled in the 
config file of tvpvrd)

This can however be a problem if you want to access the daemon on your
server as a regular web-site. For example to be able to connect from a client
which only allows plain http (or https) traffic and blocks all other ports.

This can be easily solved by using apache as a proxy. By enabling the module
mod_proxy you can add, for example, the lines


ProxyRequests Off

<Proxy *>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

ProxyPass /pvr http://localhost:9301
ProxyPassReverse /pvr http://localhost:9301


in the apache config file for the main or virtual host. This makes it possible
to access the server by giving the URL

http://localhost/pvr/

instead. See Apache mod_proxy for explanation of the specific settings.


Some additional notes on configuration file
===========================================
There are quite a few optional settings in the configuration file. Some
configurations really must be adapted to the local server (like directories
where to store videos) but for the majority of users the default values
for most settings should be ok.

In order to simplify the process of adjusting the config file there are two
templates for the config file. One simplified which only contains the most
common options (which uses the default values for all other settings)
and one full template. Use one of these templates, the choice  is yours,
and then copy it to a file 'tvpvrd.conf" in the config directory and make
the necessary changes.

Installing the optional tvpowerd daemon
=======================================
For most users this is NOT needed!

The optional power daemon can be found under 'src/tvpowerd'. Since it is supposed
to be installed on a different server than the recording daemon it will not be
installed with the make install command. Instead copy the distribution package
to the server where you want to run the power daemon, configure and compile as
usual and then run the 'install.sh' script as root.
(The install.sh is found in the tvpowerd directory)


Notes on Specific Linux distributions
=====================================

Generic
-------
The package requires the three libraries libpcre (Perl Compatible Regular
expressions), libiniparser (a library to read ini files) and libxml2.

For most Linux distributions those packages are available under names
similar to "libpcre3-devel", "libiniparser-devel" and "libxml2-devel".

If the iniparser library cannot be found the package will use a built-in
version in order to make the installation as smooth as possible.

OpenSuSE
--------
The package is known to build and install without any problems.
The two necessary libraries are available as packages
 - libiniparser-devel and 
 - pcre-devel
 - libxml2-devel

Fedora 13
---------
The package is known to build and install without any problems. All
needed libraries are available as pre-built packages.

Linux Mint/Ubuntu 10.xx
-----------------------
The package itself is know to build without any problem but
unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a pre-built package of
iniparser library. So a built-in version will be used.

However it is recommended to try to install the iniparser library since
many other packages rely on this library as well.

1. Download the iniparser library from http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/

2. Unpack and move to the installed directory and run 'make'

3. Install the libraries (as root)
   a) cp src/iniparser.h src/dictionary.h /usr/include
   b) cp libiniparser.a libiniparser.so.0 /usr/lib
   c) ln -s /usr/lib/libiniparser.so.0 /usr/lib/libiniparser.so
   d) Update the linker cache by running:
      $>ldconfig

You should now be able to compile and install the tvpvrd package

`configure' Invocation
======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--help=short'
`--help=recursive'
     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
     also present in any nested packages.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--prefix=DIR'
     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *Note Installation Names::
     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
     the installation locations.

`--sysconfdir=DIR'
    Use DIR as rpefix for system configuration files. This is normally /etc or
    /usr/local/etc

`--no-create'
`-n'
     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
     files.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.


Installing From Repository
==========================

If you are not using the tar ball but have just grabbed the latest source from the
repository there are two things to keep in mind.

1. It may not build ... there is no guarantee that any arbitrary snapshot of the
   repository represents a stable, tested environment.

2. You must have the autotools available. If you do not know what this is then please
   use the prepared package.

If despite these warnings you want to go ahead. Then read on.

Setting up a  build environment
-------------------------------
(It is assumed you are at the root of the installed directory)

Recreate a build environment that will setup the necessary autotools files and compile

   $ bldscript/bootstrap.sh && configure && make -j4
   
If you happen to be on an Debian/Ubuntu/linux Mint system you can automatically
install all 3:rd pary dependencies needed to build by instead running

   $ bldscript/bootstrap-deb.sh && configure && make -j4

The install the daemon as usual with

$ sudo make install
[EOF]
