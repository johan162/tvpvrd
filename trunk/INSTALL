Installation Instructions

Basic Installation
==================

   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should
configure, build, and install this package.  The following
more-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for
instructions specific to this package.

We recommend the following basic configuration arguments for a modern
installation 

$> ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

This will put the executable in '/usr/bin' and the create the 
configuration directory '/etc/tvpvrd/'. Without these argument the 
default base installation location will be '/usr/local' 
(and '/usr/local/etc')

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' (see above) to configure the package for your system.

     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints
     some messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Notes on Specific Linux distributions
=====================================

Generic
-------
The package requires the three libraries libpcre (Perl Compatible Regular
expressions), libiniparser (a library to read ini files) and libxml2.

For most Linux distributions those packages are available under names
similar to "libpcre3-devel", "libiniparser-devel" and "libxml2-devel".

If the iniparser library cannot be found the package will use a built-in
version in order to make the installation as smooth as possible.

OpenSuSE
--------
The package is known to build and install without any problems.
The two necessary libraries are available as packages
 - libiniparser-devel and 
 - pcre-devel
 - libxml2-devel

Fedora 13
---------
The package is known to build and install without any problems. All
needed libraries are available as pre-built packages.

Ubuntu 10.10
------------
The package itself is know to build without any problem but
unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a pre-built package of
iniparser library. So a built-in version will be used.

However it is recommended to try to install the iniparser library since
many other packages rely on this library as well.

1. Download the iniparser library from http://ndevilla.free.fr/iniparser/

2. Unpack and move to the installed directory and run 'make'

3. Install the libraries (as root)
   a) cp src/iniparser.h src/dictionary.h /usr/include
   b) cp libiniparser.a libiniparser.so.0 /usr/lib
   c) ln -s /usr/lib/libiniparser.so.0 /usr/lib/libiniparser.so
   d) Update the linker cache by running:
      $>ldconfig

You should now be able to compile and install the tvpvrd package

`configure' Invocation
======================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--help'
`-h'
     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--help=short'
`--help=recursive'
     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's
     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used
     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options
     also present in any nested packages.

`--version'
`-V'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,
     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to
     disable caching.

`--config-cache'
`-C'
     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
`-q'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To
     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error
     messages will still be shown).

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`--prefix=DIR'
     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *Note Installation Names::
     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning
     the installation locations.

`--sysconfdir=DIR'
    Use DIR as rpefix for system configuration files. This is normally /etc or
    /usr/local/etc

`--no-create'
`-n'
     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output
     files.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run
`configure --help' for more details.
