bootstrap-deb-sh - Bootstrap script for Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint type system

PURPOSE
This is a simple shell script to be used after the repository has been downloaded to
setup the initial build environment on a Debian/Ubuntu/Linux Mint type system.

Note: If the installation tar-ball has been downloaded this file is not included
since the configure script is pre-generated for end users just compiling and 
installing the package.

RATIONALE

In order to use GNU/autotools in a normal installation a configuration script is
generated which is supposed to be run by the end user installing the package using
the traditioal triple

./configure && make && make install

However the actual configuration script is created by the autotools from a 
configuration.ac For an end user this step is not needed since a configuration
script is generated in the installation tar ball.

However in the repository there is no generated files stored. ONly original
files. Hence, if the package is built from the actual repository then the
configuration script must be re-created with the help of autotools.

This script can then be run after the repository has been downloaded to create
an initial ubild environment. It will first make sure a number of needed packages
are installed and then perform the actual bootstrap of the autotools.

This script is only meant to be run once to created the initial enviroment. Any changes
hereafter is adapted to by running autoreconf which is done automatically by the 
utility scripts "./stdbuild.sh" which will do all necessary steps to perform a build
of the entire package.
