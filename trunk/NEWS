=======================================================================================


v4.0.0
------
User visible changes:
    - Add setting web_autodisplay_transc to optionally hide transcoding information
      if there are no ongoing transcodings.
    - Add setting to select if "Quick Recording" should be displayed in Web-UI
    - Distribution now has extended support for theming of the Web-UI. Distribution 
      ships with five different CSS themes for the web-interface.      
    - Add optional selector for theme in the Web-UI
    - Directory structure for the config directory changed to make it cleaner
      with a separate "virtual" web-root among other things.
    - The 'o' (query ongoing recording) command now takes an optional card number as 
      argument.
    - Added Web-menu entry for mailing history.
    - Increased history default length to 99
    - Removed Web-menu for detailed driver settings (this is an advanced
      function that doesn't really make sense in the simplified Web-interface)
    - Added VERBOSE_LOG level 4 which also give RTC debug information in shutdown mail
    - Some layout changes in the Web-interface to emphasis recording and some CSS tweaks

Bugs fixed:
    - Handling of multibyte (utf-8) strings was not properly handled by the printf()
      function in calculating the field width. This meant that columns in the 
      output was not always correctly aligned depending on the actual content of the
      strings.

Internal changes:
    - The micro web server now behaves more like a real webserver in serving
      static files. The server is now more general but still targeted to tvpvrd
      due to the handling of commands.
    - Multibyte strings for titles are now calculated separately with help of 
      wide-char routines.
    - Refactored transcoding and utility modules by breaking them up to be more logically
      coherent and easier to maintain.
    - Refactored server shutdown handling
    - Various minor code cleanup, spelling errors, more consistent use of siezeof() etc.
    - Don't log errors if the startup/shutdown scripts doesn't exist
    

v3.3.5
------
User visible changes:
    - The history XML DB now includes human readable version of the start and end
      times. This makes it easier to use a XSL stylesheets to display the DB directly
      in browser. Otherwise a timestamp conversion must be carried out in XSL which
      requires EXSL to be within reason. Unfortunately very few browsers implement
      EXSL directly so the timestamp would force conversion to HTML via for example
      'xsltproc' first.
    - Added XSL stylesheet to view history directly in editor
    - Added nice HTML formatting when sending history in mail

Bugs fixed:
    - Problem with timeout in the 'rhm' (Mail history command) command due to missing 
      newline.

Internal changes:
    - Refactored CSS handling of tables to its own module (listhtml.c/.h)


v3.3.4
------
User visible changes:
    - Added check at startup that all specified channels in the station/channel alias
      file (e.g. xawtv) really exists in the frequency map used. Give a fatal error in
      case of error.
    - "List all" now uses the same format for the listing as as "List single" and 
      "List repeat" commands. (This has bother my esthetic side for a long time!)

Bugs fixed:
    - None.

Internal changes:
    - None.

v3.3.3
------
User visible changes:
    - Accept both "exit" and "quit" to quit from shell.
    - Added list header for 'lh' command, improved list layout.
    - Adjusted profile settings for tnormal and thigh profiles.

Bugs fixed:
    - Fixed a wrong "No recordings" text at end of listing of single recordings in
      one circumstance (when only one recording exists). 

Internal changes:
    - Read startup script before XML database is read.
    - Adjusted some modules startup order to be able to get log printout even earlier
      in startup phase.
    - Add a longer delay (sleep) in startup if the daemon detect it is started at the 
      same time as the server is powered on to allow all fs remote mounts to finish safely
      before the daemon tries to access the file system.


v3.3.2
------
User visible changes:
    - Added vpre1 setting in profile to control the preset used in the first pass
      of a two pass encoding.
    - Changed drop down in Web-GUI for specifying day from "Today" to "Auto" which 
      better reflects how it actually works. 

Bugs fixed:
    - None.

Internal changes:
    - None.



v3.3.1
------
User visible changes:
    - None 

Bugs fixed:
    - AMD64 build issue with warning in printf() format string

Internal changes:
    - Added "svntag" utility script to tag releases in build process
      to avoid typing the long repository name every time


v3.3.0
------
User visible changes:
    - Added "today" as option in dropdown instead of blank
    - Improved history formatting
    - To finish the command line both "quit" and "exit" can be used
    - Web interface empty weekday (meaning today) changed to "today"
    - Upgraded handling of ffmpeg to a newer version. This means changes
      in the profile handling of max video rate as well as the h264 naming
      of the preset files. By default to make it more compatible with various
      ffmpeg versions the default preset is now empty.
      This also removes support for older versions of ffmpeg. Stick with
      v3.2.1 if you are using older versions of ffmpeg.

Bugs fixed:
    - None 

Internal changes:
    - Added additional error check to catch the case when a remote file server
      where we store recordings and database is not responding properly


v3.2.1
------
User visible changes:
    - None 

Bugs fixed:
    - Fixed critical segfault crash in shutdown check when the recording queue happened to be empty.

Internal changes:
    - None


v3.2.0
------
User visible changes:
    - Added history keeping for last N recordings with commands to view. 
      Command 'rh' (recorded history)  

Bugs fixed:
    - A harmless but un-necessary '/' in filepaths was removed

Internal changes:
    - Some minor code cleanup

v3.1.3
------
User visible changes:
    - None. 

Bugs fixed:
    - None.

Internal changes:
    - Code cleanup to pass cleanly with new gcc 4.6.0 maximum warnings settings.
      gcc 4.6.0 adds a new warning flag -Wunused-but-set-variable that gave some
      warnings that needed handling.

v3.1.2
------
User visible changes:
    - tvpsh now checks that the server is reachable at startup and quits with error if not.
    - Added "external_tuner_station" setting in the config file. This will set the tuner
      input station when external channel switching is used and the input is specified
      as the tuner input. Used to connect a cable box with a set frequency/channel to the
      TV-card and changing channels with an IR sender on the cable box instead of the
      tuner in the TV-card.
    - Improved the manual page on how to handle an external cable box with IR-sender 
      using the external channel switching.

Bugs fixed:
    None.

Internal changes:
    - Fixed compiler warning about set but not used variable
    - Code security review. Make sure all string concatenation are explicitely limited.
    - Add full path for killproc/startproc in the SysV init.d scripts 
    - Updated OpenSuSE RPM Spec file


v3.1.1
------
User visible changes:
    None.

Bugs fixed:
    - Build without warning on amd64 architecture (complaints about "%03d" format when "%03zu" should be used)
    - Gracefully handle running tvpsh when no tvpvrd.conf can be found

Internal changes:
    None.


v3.1.0
------
User visible changes:
    - Added a real client shell 'tvpsh' program to interact with the daemon.
      This have features like full command line editing and  history (using GNU readline).
      By allowing the shell to be used as an interactive login shell (adding it to
      /etc/shells) it is possible to create a user that will use this shell as the login
      shell. It is then possible to login to the server, for example using ssh, as this
      user to interact with the daemon.
    - Don't give an error on empty command. Just ignore it.
    - Remove the prompt from the pure TCP/IP command since it causes all kinds
      of issues with the real client added to 3.1.0
    - 'lr' command was split into 'lr' and 'lu' command to make the commands orthogonal

Bugs fixed:
    - Don't write the prompt after each timeout in the client interface
    - Added documentation for "mlg" (mail log) command
    - Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0.6 whereby a cancelling request for an ongoing recording
      via the Web interface was not recognized

Internal changes:
    - Refactored logging routines to it's own source file
    - Each command output now ends with a "\r\n" sequence to indicated end of command output
    - Make code compile clean even with -Wshadow flag added. The code now compiles clean 
      with gcc flags: 
        -pedantic -Wall -Werror -Wpointer-arith -Wstrict-prototypes -Wextra -Wshadow -Wformat=2  

v3.0.6
------
User visible changes:
    - Added use_mobile flag in the config file to allow user to determine if the modified
      phone WEB-UI should be used or not when connection from a phone is detected.
    - Added string "(tvpvrd) " as prompt for the TCP/IP interface
    - If a transcoding is forced to stop by user then keep the original MP2 file and directory in
      the vtmp directory.
    - Add "mlg - mail log file" command which will send the entire logfile in a mail to the predefined
      system ail address. The logfile is sent as an attachment.

Bugs fixed:
    - Fixed CSS issue that caused the link in the last two menu items not to be active
    - Fixed bug where the wrong min shutdown time was read from the config file (copy&paste error)

Internal changes:
    - Changed command format in URL string
    - Logger now eliminates repeated messages and just prints how many of the same message



v3.0.5
------
User visible changes:
    - Optimized Web-GUI minute list to better match start and end times often used
    - Added 'lm' command. Will mail the list of recordings (in both plain and HTML format) to the
      email address specified to receive mails.  The format of the HTML mail is controlled by CSS
      styles and adjustable in the config file in the "format" section
    - Added hyper-linked transcoding profiles in the Web-interface to allow easy viewing of profile details
    - Added 'lmr' command - Send repeat and single recordings in HTML format in a mail
    - Added 'lr' command list repeating and single recordings in text format
    - Updated menu structure in Web-interface to include the mailing commands 'lm' and 'lmr'


Bugs fixed:
    - Fixed a bug whereby if a recurring recording had the new type Tue-Fri (7) it gave an error
      when the server was restarted and claimed it was an unrecognized recurring type. This was a 
      false alarm since the range check had not been updated to reflect this new type.

Internal changes:
    - None.


v3.0.4
------
User visible changes:
    - Minor change in menu for WEB-interface (Added "Disk space")
    - Some minor tweaks in the layout for mobile phone version of the web interface
    - Added repeat type: n=Tue-Fri

Internal changes:
    - Updated file headers.


v3.0.3
------
User visible changes:
    - Added 'df' = 'Display used and total disk space' command
    - Added information on disk usage in transcoding notification mail (updated mail templates)

Internal changes:
    - None.


v3.0.2
------
User visible changes:
    - Fix an issue introduced in the last minute for 3.0.0 which could wrongly find colliding
      recordings even when multiple video cards where available. Lessons learned: Never ,never
      do a "simple" change before a release ...

Internal changes:
    - Added some more verbose debug output with time stamp translation.
    - Added a sanity check when reading the database to detect errors in time specification.


v3.0.1
------
User visible changes:
    - Fix some minor build issues specific to a x86_64 platform

Internal changes:
    - None.

v3.0.0
------
User visible changes:
    - Update XML DB format.
        -- Removed the specific "video" field. This is not necessary. Better to assign new
           video cards when the DB file is read at startup. This will also make it possible
           to dynamically add and remove video cards while still maintaining an optimal
           recording schedule (as far as permitted).
        -- Bumped DB version to "2". Any existing version "1" DBs will be automatically updated.

    - Added new flag for configure "--enable-stacktrace"
      This will help with remote end user debugging (if ever needed) when they cannot create
      a core dump.  If enabled a stacktrace will be stored in a file, '/tmp/tvpvrd_stack.crash'
      (hardcoded name), when the daemon receives a SIGSEGV or SIGBUS signal. Added "-rdynamic"
      as a compiler switch to force better stack traces. This is not as complete as a full
      gdb trace (with all threads) but better than nothing if this is ever needed (knock on
      wood...)

    - Update of the CSS for mobile browsing for better readability

    - Added "af - Add recordings from file" command to make it possible to prepare a list
      of recordings offline

    - Added configuration option "use_repeat_rec_basedir" to have all repeated
      recordings for the same show stored under a subdirectory named after the
      base-name of the recording (i.e. without all the date and repeat information).

    - Don't ship a 'tvpvrd.conf' file directly. Instead ship two template files for the config
      'tvpvrd.conf.simplified.template' and 'tvpvrd.conf.full.template' which will force the user
      to at least once check them and rename them to 'tvpvrd.conf'. The two template files
      corresponds to a simplified config file relying mostly on the default values and one
      template file with all the settings spelled out. This has been done as a feeble try to
      simplify the setup.

    - Added template based mail setup for shutdown and transcoding mails

    - Added a basic SMTP mail sending library to allow for more advanced formatting of mails

    - Updated INSTALL file with some information on extra steps needed
      if building directly from the repository

    - Added --with-libpcre-prefix option to "configure" to allow user to specify
      alternative locations for PCRE library

    - Added possibility to run a user supplied startup script and added a
      suitable template for such a script.

    - Added option to send HTML formatted mail notifications. The  templates
      for the mails are stored in the configuration directory.

    - Added option to use specified SMTP server directly to send mail

    - Updated template for hook scripts

    - Added post transcoding script hook and associated template in config

    - Changed structure of config file so that all mail related settings are in
      its own section.

    - Fixed a memory leak when CSS file was not modified when using the WEB-interface

Internal changes:
    - The login cookie used now restricts itself to only use characters from
      0-9A-Xa-z_ to allow the cookies to pass through some over restricting
      WebProxys which filters out cookies with character outside this range.
      In addition the cookie header no longer adds the "Version" attribute
      since, again, some proxys will filter out the cookie if this attribute
      is included. (This is most likely user visible as well)

    - Fix a possible buffer overwrite when converting cookies to URL character
      escaped encoding

    - Some further code refactoring to reduce size of 'tvpvrsrv.c'

    - Improved the usability of the key/val replacement routines

    - Cleaned up header inclusions

    - Some internal code restructuring to reduce the size of the main tpvrsrv.c
      file by creating vcard.c/vcard.h and some other move of code to more appropriate
      places.

    - Some include header streamlining

    - Update network code to use the more modern getaddrinfo() system call

    - Reworked he build system so that iniparser is now an archive library

    - Added base64 and quoted-printable functionality since that is needed for mails

    - Added SIGABRT handler to get some notifications when using glibs memory
      checking routines MALLOC_CHECK

    - Changed configuration so ininparser is built as a proper library. Makes the
      build scripts slightly cleaner.

    - Refactored all xstr* routines to there own source module


v2.3.0 [r377]
-------------
User visible changes:
    - Added automatic shutdown in the server itself by making use of the BIOS
      real time clock. This will power off the daemon until its time for next
      recording.

    - Give WEB user the login page instead of not found if he/she is not logged
      in and gives an invalid command.

    - Slightly increase the quality in the default profiles with increased bitrate.
      (disk space i cheap)

    - Add some missing information in the list settings command

    - Updated documentation (man pages) to reflect changes

Internal changes:
    - Internal code restructuring and refactoring in preparation for more advanced
      mail processing as well as easier maintenance
    - Increase allowed bps range for video ffmpeg encoding
    - Reduce complexity of the utils module


v2.2.0
------
User visible changes:
  - Added option to specify an optional post recording script that is run
    after the recording has been done but before the transcoding starts.
    The script is stored in the configuration directory. The package includes
    a template file "postrec_processing.sh.template" that can be used as a
    starting point for such a script. The script is given the full video
    filename and its length (in seconds) as two arguments.

  - To support cards which use two different device interfaces for tuner and
    MPEG encoded stream the configuration file now allow a separate setting
    of both tuner and encoder device through the two options:
    1) TUNER_DEVICE<n>    (where <n> is the card number)
    2) ENCODER_DEVICE<n>  (where <n> is the card number)
    See the configuration file for an even more detailed description

Internal changes:
  - Internal change so that all v4l API calls regarding controls are now going
    through the modern extended control interface (both user and mpeg class controls)
    This will make the daemon more robust to a larger class of video/recorder cards.


v2.1.1
------
Fixes an oversight in the build process for 2.1.0 when building
from a fresh directory when no buildnumber.txt file did exist
in the tvpowerd directory.

v2.1.0
------
Mainly internal changes. Added buildnumber handling and some utility build
scripts. Tweaked the timing for tvpowerd daemon so that it waits a  bit longer
to really be sure that the ivtv driver ha loaded correctly. The day of the
ultimum autotools build script setup has finally come!


v2.1.0beta3
-----------
Added configuration option --enable-webdebug to add extra debugging
printout in reagrds to low level HTTP handling. This only has effect
with loglevel 3.
Refactored tvwebcmd file into two files for ease of maintenance.
Some further minor tweaks in the build system. One day the project
will finally have the ultimum autotools and script setup and now we are
getting close ...

v2.1.0-beta2
------------
Added configuration option --enable-simulate to build a version of the daemon
that runs on a server without TV card

v2.1.0-beta
-----------

Added new options "external_switch" to the configuration file to allow
external channel switching on a cable box. Enabling this feature will
make the card always read the input from the input source "external_input" 
specified in the configuration file. 

Channel switching is then made by  the daemon by calling the "switchchannel.sh" 
script in the tvpvrd configuration directory, This script is provided as 
a template that must be updated to correspond to the actual setup to change 
channel. The channel switching is normally made by send an IR beam to the 
cable box. This is done by the LIRC subsystem which must be installed and 
configured.

It is entirely up to the end user of this to configure and install any and
all needed LIRC support. This must unfortunately be done by the end user since
it is impossible to in advance know what channel switching commands to send
that corresponds to a certain station name

The channel switching script then calls "irsend" with appropriate commands
depending on which channel should be used. It is up to th end user to adjust
the included "switchchannel.sh.template" file and rename it to "switchchannel.sh"

Since I don't have access to a cable box this will remain in beta until I 
have received user confirmation that this works as intended.

v2.0.1
------

Add option to unload the ivtv driver when the recording server is shutdown
by the tvpowerd daemon. This is needed if the shutdown method is suspend
to RAM or hibernate since the ivtv driver is not power management aware.

This option is controlled by the boolean configuration file variables
unload_ivtv_driver

In addition there were some minor documentation update. For detailed
changes please refer to the ChangeLog.


v2.0.0
------

This release has a completely reworked build and configuration script setup.
The configuration is now a first class citizen of the autotools country.

This means that it will build and install itself in many more distributions.

The packages is known to work out of the box on

- OpenSuSE 11.1 and 11.3 (not tested on 11.2)
 -Ubuntu 10.10
- Fedora 13
- Debian Lenny as well as Debian Sid

In addition this release includes an optional companion daemon 'tvpowerd'. This daeomon
is supposed to run on a different server than the recording server. When enabled it will
manage the power of the recording daemon and turn it off and on according to the scheduled
recordings. This will avoid the recording server running when no recording (or transcoding
is taking place). In order for this to work the recording server must support Wake-On-Lan
fot the managing server to be able to turn the power on.

The power daemon can be found under 'src/tvpowerd'. Since it is supposed to be installed
on a different server than the recording daemon it will not be installed with the
make install command. Instead copy the distribution package to the server where you want to
run the power daemon, configure and compile and the run the 'install.sh' script as root.
(The install.sh is found in the tvpowerd directory)

For more details see ChangeLog
