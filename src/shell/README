$Id$

This directory contains a very basic shell program which connects 
to the tvpvrd daemon using the TCP/IP port specified in the config 
file for tvpvrd.

This is alternative way to connect and issue commands to the daemon
than to connect using telnet. It is also more convenient since this
supports history and command line editing.

Using this shell it is also possible to create a specific user on the 
server and then use this program as the shell for that user. In that 
way it is possible to connect to the daemon by logging in to the server 
using for example ssh, as a normal user. 

The password handling will then be controlled by the normal Unix password 
as specified in /etc/passwd (or shadow passwords if that is used).

See INSTALL for more details on how to configure the shell as the login
shell for a user.
