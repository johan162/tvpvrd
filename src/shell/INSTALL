INSTALL file for tvpsh - A basic shell replacement to interact with the daemon

This program normally gets installed under "/usr/bin/tvpsh"

Steps to install

1. Add the the shell as one of the allowed user interactive shells in /etc/shells
2. Create a new user. How this is done depends on your system. Most systems now aday
   have some kind of administrative GUI that will allow you to add a user, password
   and the loginshell to be used for that user.

   If you want to do this manually the following steps my guide you. We assume that
   the user name you want to create is "pvr"

   2.0 Switch to root user

   2.1 Add the following line to /etc/passwd

       pvr:x:0:0:tvpvrd shell user:/home/pvr:/usr/bin/tvpshell

       (Here we assume that you name your user "pvr"). Save "/etc/passwd"

   2.2 Update the password by calling

       $> passwd pvr

       and type your new password when questioned

   2.3 If your system uses a shadow password file (most system does) now type

       $> pwconv

       This will take out the password from the /etc/passwd file and move it to /etc/shadow

   2.4. Create an empty home directory (this will of course not be used but must
        exist for the Unix login to work)

        $> mkdir /home/pvr

   2.5. Verify that the shell exists in /usr/bin/tvpsh

   2.6. You should now be able to login to the server by issuing (for example) the command

        $> ssh pvr@<server>

        where <server> must be replace by the name/ip-number of your server.
