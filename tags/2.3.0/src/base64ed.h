 * Description: Routines for doing base64 encoding and decoding. See
 *              RFC3548 for details (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3548.txt)
 *              Note: These routines are not necessarily written to achive
 *              maximum speed but rather maximum clarity to aviod nasty
 *              off by one bugs.
