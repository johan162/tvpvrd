This directory contains script to start and stop the daemon as a system service. 

These scripts are installed under '${sysconfdir}/init.d/'

Since there are two major ways of writing these service script, the debian way 
and the "other" way there are two templates. Which one to install is determined 
by the configuration script which figures out which one to install.

The xsl transformation script is used to re-format the output from the 
svn log command into a format more suitable for a ChangeLog. This script is
only used by package maintainer.
