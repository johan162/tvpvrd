                </citerefentry> command starts a video recording server that will make use of one or
                more installed TV-Capture cards and, following a specified schedule, will record
                broadcasted and encoded streams from the capture card to disk. In effect a digital
                version of a programmable VHS. In a similar way as a VCR the daemon also have the
                capability to shutdown and power on the server in time for recordings (see the
                auto-shutdown section below). In the same way as the old-fashioned VHS it has the
                capability to turn off the power of the server and wake it up in time for a
                recording in a fully automated way (by using the BIOS wakeup alarm).</para>
            <para>The original HW MPEG2 encoded videofile (from the capture card) can then be
                optionally transcoded (using <citerefentry>
                    <refentrytitle>ffmpeg</refentrytitle>
                    <manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
                </citerefentry> ) to a more efficient format by the daemon. The specific details on
                both the initial HW encoder settings as well as the transcoding options are bundled
                in a user configurable 'profile'. The daemon supports the usage of  multiple
                profiles. </para>
            <para>Each recording is done using one (or multiple) profiles. Each recording will
                always have at least one profile, the primary profile. In this way it is possible to
                create multiple transcoded versions of one recording, for example one high quality
                version for viewing on a computer and one low quality versions for viewing on a
                mobile device. By default the distribution includes six profiles 'high', 'normal',
                'low' without transcoding and 'thigh', 'tnormal', 'tlow' with transcoding enabled.
                Additional profiles can easily be added by the user. A profile is specified in the
                traditional ini-file text file format and is stored under the 'profiles' directory
                which is a subdirectory to the settings directory (normally
                    <filename>/etc/tvpvrd</filename>). Each setting in the profile is well
                documented in the profiles. </para>
            <para>The primary interface to the server is via a TCP/IP connection to the server
                running '<emphasis>tvpvrd</emphasis>' via a dedicated port (by default 9300). The
                server is controlled via a simple (but efficient) command language which allows
                manipulation of future recordings and various other administrative tasks. All
                commands are extensively described in the section 'Command language' below. </para>
            <para>As an optional way there is also a native basic WEB-interface that allows a
                limited number of commands such as basic adding of new recording, deleting existing
                recordings, viewing status, showing upcoming recordings etc. The WEB-interface must
                be enabled in the ini-file since it is by default disabled. The WEB interface is
                accessed on port number (port+1) i.e one more than the port number specified for the
                command interface. This means that by default the WEB-interface is available on port
                9301. The WEB-interface can optionally require a separate login as specified in the
                configuration file. </para>
            <para>To access the WEB interface from a browser simple give the server address and port
                number. For example to access the daemon on the server "<code>localhost</code>" with
                the default port number use URL "<filename>http://localhost:9301</filename>". </para>
            <para>The look and feel of the WEB-interface is entirely controlled by a CSS style sheet
                stored in the configuration directory (usually specified as
                    <filename>/etc</filename>). This is the same place as where the configuration
                file is stored. This means it is straightforward to change the look and feel from
                the default colors and layout.</para>
            <para>The WEB interface will also automatically adapt when it detects that a mobile
                phone browser is trying to access the interface to a format more suitable for the
                smaller screen on mobile phones. By necessity this means that only a subset of the
                full command set is available from the browser on a phone in order to keep the
                interface simple. The detection is based on the header that the browser sends and
                should detect most phones. However, it is possible that some browsers used on mobile
                phone will not be detected as mobile browsers and then the normal WEB interface will
                be used.</para>
            <para>The recordings specified are stored in a database which is a plain text file in
                XML format using UTF-8 character encoding.</para>
            <para>Recorded and transcoded files are stored in a predefined directory structure. The
                base directory for this directory structure is defined in the configuration file,
                see also the section "Directory Structure" below.</para>

                options.</para>
            <para>The second script is '<filename>stop-tvpvrd</filename>' which will read the server

                directory and must be removed manually.</para>
            <para>If the server gives the error message : "<emphasis>Server can not be started. See
                    system log</emphasis>" then more information about the details of the problem
                can be found in the system log, normally <filename>/var/log/messages</filename>. One
                common issue might be a stale lock file (in
                <filename>/var/run/tvpvrd.pid</filename>) in case the server is not started from the
                root user. The reason is that in order to write these lock files the server must run
                as a root. Since normally the server only runs as a root at the startup phase (and
                then switches over to the selected user) the lock/pid file cannot be removed. This
                is not a problem if the server is again started as root but if the server is started
                from the command line as a non-root user it will complain that the lock file already
                exists. The solution in this case is to manually remove the lockfile (as
                root).</para>

            <title>Automatic shutdown and startup of the server</title>
            <para>In the same way as a VCR (or a modern HD recorder) has the capability to shut down
                and power on in time for recording the tvpvrd can do this with the server it is
                running on. The daemon package has two radically different way to do this and
                depending on your preference (and/or HW) either way can be chosen. The server
                supports either the usage of the internal BIOS real time clock using a wakeup alarm
                or running a power management daemon (<command>tvpowerd</command>) on a separate
                server. If you have a reasonable modern server (say 2005 or newer) it will most
                likely support BIOS wakeup alarm and since that is the easiest method we strongly
                recommend you use that method.</para>

                <title>Method 1: Using the BIOS wakeup alarm on the server running the tvpvrd
                    daemon</title>
                <para>To use this method it is first important to recognize that the daemon must be
                    running as user '<code>root</code>' in order to have the privilege to shut down
                    the server.</para>
                <para>To enable this feature it must first be enabled in the configuration file
                    under the section <code>[shutdown]</code> . By default this feature is disabled.
                    There are then some basic parameters that should be checked according to
                    preference. For example the parameter <code>ignore_users</code> will determine
                    if the shutdown should still happen if there are user logged in to the server or
                    not. All the available parameters are fully specified and documented in the
                    default configuration file.</para>
                <para>To make this work the daemon assumes that the RTC (BIOS Real Time Clock)
                    presents an interface on the
                    "<filename>/sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm</filename>" that can be used to set the
                    time in seconds since Epoc when the server should wake up if it is powered off.
                    In some BIOS it is also necessary to first enable the wakeup alarm by changing
                    some default setting (check your BIOS documentation).</para>
                <para>In order not to miss the recording the server is woken up a little bit before
                    the actual recording time. By default this is 180 sec which should be enough
                    time for even old servers to fully wake up. This pre-wakeup time is configurable
                    in the configuration file. </para>
                <para>The actual shutdown of the server is done by the
                        "<filename>shutdown.sh</filename>" script stored in the configuration
                    directory. In the distribution this is included as a template
                        "<filename>shutdown.sh.template</filename>" which can then be augmented. By
                    default the script initiates a complete server shutdown and if that is enough
                    the template can just be copied and renamed. </para>
                <para>If the server is reasonable new it might be possible to do a sleep (or
                    hibernate) instead but in that case we would recommend using the second method
                    of auto-shutdown using the separate "<command>tvpowerd</command>" as described
                    below. Please note that there are some special precautions that must be taken to
                    use sleep or hibernation mode since the ivtv-driver is not power management
                    aware. So unless absolutely necessary please use the safe and always working
                    method of just doing a complete shutdown. See <citerefentry>

                <title>Method 2: Using the tvpowerd-daemon on a separate server</title>
                <para>Since some older motherboards does not have a working BIOS wakeup clock and
                    for the case where you rather sleep (or hibernate) the server instead of
                    shutting it down the package gives an alternative auto-shutdown method using the
                        "<command>tvpowerd</command>" daemon. This is a separate daemon that must be
                    run on a separate server. This daemon will then communicate with the server
                    running the recording daemon and shut the server down and power it on according
                    to the recording schedule. The power on will be done using Wakeup-On-LAN so this
                    must be enabled in the BIOS on the recording server. There is a complete
                    separate manual page describing all the details on how to use this daemon in <citerefentry>

                <title>When shall I use Method 1 and when shall I use Method 2 ?</title>
                <para>If only one server is available and the motherboard supports the RTC wakeup
                    alarm then method 1 is the preferred way. Even if you have multiple servers
                    available it is still easier to use method 1.  However there is one circumstance
                    where it might be more practically to use the <command>tvpowerd</command>
                    standalone daemon. For the common case where you have a NFS or SMB file share
                    exposed from the recording server, for example to be able to view the videos on
                    another computer, there are all kinds off issues if the SMB or NFS server is
                    just shut down without the share unmounted. Especially the NFS protocol is
                    notoriously bad in handling a disconnected server without a proper unmount.
                    Running the separate <command>tvpowerd</command> daemon on the client will allow
                    you to put in the necessary unmount commands in the shutdown script (assuming
                    the tvpowerd is running on the server mounting shares). </para>
                <para>In future releases of <command>tvpvrd</command> it will be possible to run
                    user selectable scripts on clients to the recording server at the shutdown time.
                    This can then be used to, for example, give the client notification that the
                    recording server is shutting down and then be able to do any necessary unmounts
                    or other cleanup activities.</para>
                <para>In the case where you rather want to suspend to RAM/DISK then it is also
                    necessary to run the separate <command>tvpowerd</command> daemon. The main
                    reason here is that since the ivtv-drivers that resides in the kernel is not
                    power management aware they must therefore be unloaded before the server is put
                    into hibernation and then reloaded when the server is woken up. This can be (and
                    is) all taken care of in the shutdown scripts for the tvpowerd daemon. However,
                    there is really no practical reason to put the recording server in
                    sleep/hibernation state compare with a full shutdown. The only thing gained is
                    faster startup time which for these use-cases are not really interesting (nor
                    necessary).</para>

            <title>Running as master or slave</title>
            <para>Normally the daemon will do necessary checks to verify that one or several video
                cards are present in order to startup. If no video cards are found the server will
                print an error message and terminate. However it is still possible to run the daemon
                on a server with no video cards by running the server in <emphasis
                    role="italic">slave</emphasis> mode. This will restrict the functionality of the
                server to only transcoding and status information commands.</para>
            <para>The primary purpose of running the server in slave configuration is to make it
                possible to use several servers to transcode video files. There are three commands "<emphasis

            <para>In future version of the server there will be possibility to configure a load

                has to be done manually.</para>
            <para>The server can be run in slave mode by either giving the "<option>-s</option>"
                option when starting the server or by setting the configuration alternative

            <title>Connecting to the server</title>
            <para>Once the server is running the easiest way to connect to the server is by using
                the '<emphasis>telnet</emphasis>' program. Assuming that the
                    <emphasis>tvpvrd</emphasis> server is running on the localhost the following
                command will connect to the server (assuming the default port 9300 has not been
                changed in the ini-file (e.g. <filename>/etc/tvpvrd.conf</filename>) or by a command

            <para>After a successful connection the server will reply with a short information
                message. The full returned information message at the connection time should look
                something similar to the following (your version and build might be

            <title>The recording and transcoding process</title>
            <para>The recording process refers to the process of saving the generated MPRG2 video
                stream from the capture card to a file.</para>
            <para>The transcoding process refers to the re-coding of the original MPEG2 video stream
                to a more efficient format, usually an MPEG4 container using H.264 video codec (the
                default in the distributed profiles). Depending on the quality settings it is common
                to see reduction in original file size with 75%.</para>
            <para>The transcoding process is very CPU-intensive and with the default settings in the
                distribution the normal profile will require anywhere between roughly 1.5 times the
                original recording length to transcode on a pentium dual core to roughly 0.5 times
                the recording length on a newer i3 or i5 Intel CPU. With a high end Intel multi-core
                i7 CPU and some basic setting the transcoding time can be down to ~0.3 times the
                length of the original recording.</para>
            <para>In order not to make the machine totally unresponsive the ini-file specifies a
                maximum load on the server for a transcoding to start in order not to load the
                server with too many parallel transcoding processes. The transcoding process is also
                run with a 'nice' value of 20 to have the transcoding process interfere as little as
                possible with any interactive use on the server. If the load is too high the
                transcoding processes will be put in a queue waiting for the load to become
                acceptable. Note that the serer will not wait forever and if the load has not
                dropped below the threshold for a certain time (as specified by the
                    <code>max_waiting_time_to_transcode</code> setting in the ini-file) the
                transcoding will be cancelled and the original MPEG2 file left alone.</para>
            <para>When a recording is started a temporary directory will be created under
                    '<filename>&lt;data-dir>/vtmp/vid&lt;n>/</filename>' where &lt;n> is the number
                of the video card used. The name of the temporary directory will be the same as the
                base name of the recording. The MPEG2 stream is read from the video card and stored
                in a file in the temporary directory with the same name as the title (converted to
                lower case) with the suffix ".mpg".</para>
            <para>If multiple profiles are specified there exists an ambiguity on what HW MPEG2
                parameters to use in case they are different among the selected profiles. The server
                resolves this by using the HW parameters from the profile with the highest specified
                video bitrate. This is motivated by the fact that using high quality encoder
                settings on a low original bitrate can never give a good result.</para>
            <para>When the recording has stopped the transcoding profile(s) is read and the
                transcoding is started after a check that the server load is not higher than the
                maximum allowed load in order to start a transcoding. If the load is too high the
                transcoding is put in a queue of waiting transcodings that will be started when the
                server load allows the transcoding to start. One transcoding will be made for each
                of the associated profiles of this recording.</para>
            <para>As a special case no transcoding will be made if the '<emphasis>ffmpeg</emphasis>'
                profile bitrate is set to 0 Mbps in the profile. In this case only the original
                MPEG2 video file will be kept.</para>
            <para>Once a transcoding has finished the resulting MP4 file will be moved either to the
                directory '<filename>&lt;data-dir>/mp4/&lt;profile>/</filename>' with the same file
                basename as the title but with the filename suffix ".mp4"  or directly under
                    <filename>'&lt;data-dir>/mp4/'</filename> depending whether or not
                subdirectories should be used for each profile (see setting file).</para>
            <para>When all the transcodings have been done and if the profile defines that the
                original MPEG2 video stream should be kept it is moved to the directory
                    '<filename>&lt;data-dir>/mp2/</filename>'. After that the temporary directory
                (and the original MPEG2 file) is deleted.</para>
            <para>Another possibility is to do the recording first and later decide to transcode one
                or several video files. This is done by giving a separate transcode command to the
                server and specify the full file path to the file to be transcoded. In order to make
                this as convenient as possible there are three variants of this. One variant is to
                transcode one video file, the other is to specify a directory where all the files in
                that directory will be transcoded. The final way is to store a number of video file
                names in a text file and use that text file as an input list of the files to
                transcode. See the command description below for the commands "<option>tf</option>",
                    "<option>td</option>" and "<option>tl</option>".</para>
            <para>Note that it is possible to get notify by mail when a transcoding has finished.

            <title>Stations, channels and frequencies</title>
            <para>All TV stations are broadcasted on a local unique frequency. The frequency
                spectrum is a natural resource that divided in internationally standardized fixed
                width channels. A channel is the same as a specified frequency. The distance between
                each assigned frequency is different depending on both the frequency area and the TV
                standard used. This depends on the fact that different TV standard requires
                different bandwidth. This channel division is also different depending on the
                geographic location. </para>
            <para>It is important to realize that these fixed frequencies are assigned according to
                international standards. In each city (and city area) the broadcasting company is
                then responsible for assigning local stations to appropriate frequency channels.
                This is the difference between station and channel names. The channel names are
                standardized names that have short name with 2 to 5 characters, for example 'SE14'.
                Even though the frequency division is standardized the exact channel names are not
                always given with the assigned names. For example a broadcasting company might claim
                (for example on their home page) that the station 'BBC1' in a certain area can be
                found on channel '14' when they actually should have said that the station can be
                found on channel 'SE14' which is the official name of this channel.</para>
            <para>To further complicate matters different countries uses different standardized
                frequency maps. The program has built in knowledge of the frequency channels

            <para>In order to record a specific station the tuner on the capture card must be tuned

                the frequency channel, e.g. SE14, the program uses yet another mapping file so it is
                possible to use station names when recording instead of frequency channels. This is
                the way most people think about "TV-Stations".</para>
            <para>In order for maximum re-use <emphasis>tvpvrd</emphasis> uses the same format of

                is a plain text file using ini-file format. In the distribution an example file is
                included. Normally your TV provider provides a channel plan for your area.
                Unfortunately, to make things a bit more difficult some broadcasting company is not
                following the international naming convention. </para>
            <para>If you are already viewing TV on your computer chances are very high that you
                already have this 'xawtvrc' ini-file since it is used by many of the available TV
                viewing programs. Common location for this file is either
                    '<filename>/etc/X11/xawtvrc</filename>' or in your home directory
                    '<filename>.xawtvrc</filename>'.</para>
            <para>An example of a station-channel mapping file is shown below (this mapping file
                happens to be the maps for a large Swedish distributor in the Stockholm
                region):</para>
            
                <screen>[Kanal5]
channel = SE11
[Kanal8]
channel = 57
[Kanal9]
channel = S36
[MTV]

[SVTB/Kunsk]
channel = SE13

channel = E7
[TV3]
channel = E11
[TV4]
channel = E6
[TV4+]
channel = SE14
[TV6]
channel = E8
</screen>
            <para>The mapping above says that for example the station "Kanal5" can be found on
                frequency channel SE11. This mapping will then make it possible to use the name
                "Kanal5" when specifying recordings which is a lot easier than to remember that this
                station is on channel "SE11".</para>
            
            <para>In some Unix distributions there are automatic frequency scanning helper programs
                (for example <citerefentry>
                    <refentrytitle>scantv</refentrytitle>
                    <manvolnum>1</manvolnum>
                </citerefentry>) which will search through a given frequency map and list all
                channels where a broadcasting was find (this is identified as a high enough signal
                strength). For example SuSE distribution have a TV channel scanning setup in the
                yast2 configuration tool. The result of this channel scan is usually stored in a
                file named '<filename>xawtvrc</filename>'. This is usually stored in either
                    '<filename>/etc/X11/xawtvrc</filename>' or in you home directory, usually as
                    '<filename>~/.awtvrc</filename>'. However the actual station names you want to
                use for the channels must of course be manually given. </para>
            <para>The somewhat strange name of the map file comes from an ancient TV viewer program
                under X11 which was/(is) called 'xawtv'. For historic reason this name has
                stayed.</para>
            <para>While it is possible to use either the station name or the channel name in a
                recording there must be a '<filename>xawtvrc</filename>' file in order for the
                server to start properly. If the station file cannot be found an error message will
                be printed and the server will not start.</para>
            <para>The location of this file is normally specified in the ini-file but the location
                can also be overridden with command line argument (<option>-x</option>) when the
                server is started (see Options) which will override the setting in the
                ini-file.</para>

            <title>Selecting alternative video inputs as source for the encoding</title>
            <para>A video capture card has normally several possible input to the HW MP2 encoder.
                When encoding TV the tuner is usually the selected input. However most cards also
                have one or several external connects that can be used to encode other video
                sources. For example Hauppauge analogue cards have one or more (depending on the
                card) S-Video inputs that could be used as source for the video encoding.</para>
            <para>The first thing to do if one wants to use one of these alternative input sources
                is to determine exactly what input sources the combination of card and low level
                driver supports. This can be done with the help of the command <command>li</command>
                . This will list all the available input sources for the specified video card. For
                example if your server have a Hauppauge 350 installed as the first card giving the
                command</para>
            <para><command>li 0</command></para>
            <para>would generate output similar to</para>
            
                <screen>Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350
00 :*(tuner) Tuner 1
01 : (camera) S-Video 1
02 : (camera) Composite 1
03 : (camera) S-Video 2
04 : (camera) Composite 2
05 : (camera) Composite 3</screen>
            
            <para>This is a list of  all possible video sources supported by the card. The current
                selected source is shown with an asterix just to the left of the type of
                input.</para>
            <para>In order to use one of these inputs as the source for the recoding instead of the
                standard tuner a special station name is used "<emphasis
                    role="italic">_inpXY</emphasis>". The 'X' should be replaced by the video card
                to be used (starting at 0) and the 'Y' should be replaced by the index for the
                wanted input source. So for example going back to the previous Hauppauge 350 above a
                meta station name of "<code>_inp04</code>" would use the composite 2 input source
                (assuming the card is the first card, i.e. 0).</para>
            <para>In order for the server to know which input belongs to the tuner this is specified
                in the config file with the setting <emphasis
                    role="italic">tuner_input_index</emphasis>, by default this is 0. Since there is
                only one setting this implies that all cards use the same index for the tuner. This
                is a limitation of the current implementation. If you have several cards where the
                tuner is located at different input indexes then the server can only work correctly
                on one card. This is a very minor limitation since the number of users with multiple
                cards with tuners on other indexes than 0 can be assumed to be very small.</para>
            <para>A final example will make this crystal clear. Assume we want to record a CCTV
                camer that is connected to composite input 1 on our Hauppauge 350 card. To
                immediately start recording for 30 min using the default profile we could give the
                command</para>
            
                <screen>q _inp02 00:30 cctv_camera_one</screen>
            
            <para>the command above would immediately start a recording using card 0 and input with
                index 2, i.e.. the "<code>Composite 1</code>" input. The recording will be stored
                with the name "<code>cctv_camera_one.mp4</code>" (assuming the default profile is
                setup to do transcoding to MP4 format).</para>
            <para>There is also an option to handle channel switching on a cable box. This is
                described in the "Adding user "hooks" for special processing" section below.</para>

            <title>Managing notifications mails</title>
            <para>When configuring the daemon it is possible to set options that will send
                notification mails on important events in the daemon. This could be notifications on
                errors that occurred but also notifications on that a transcoding was finished or
                that the server was shutdown automatically while waiting for the next
                recording.</para>
            <para>All mail settings are specified in the "<code>[mail]</code>" section of the

            <para>Sending mails can be done by either using a specified SMTP server (in the
                configuration file) or by using the systems own "<command>mail</command>" command.
                However, if you chose the latter you cannot ask the server to send HTML formatted
                mails (by setting the configuration "<code>use_html=yes</code>"), only plain text
                mail with the systems built in "<command>mail</command>" command. </para>
            <para>The actual text (and formatting in case of HTML mails) are controlled by templates
                that are stored in the general configuration directory. All templates are prefixed

                    "<code>*.html</code>" version. The text version is used when sending plain text
                messages and the HTML version when sending HTML formatted mails. In complying with
                internet mail standards the plain version is also included in the mail even when
                sending HTML formatted mails so that mail clients that are unable to display HTML
                format will use the plain text version instead. (HTML mails are formatted according
                to internet standard MIME attachment rules.)</para>

            <title>Adding user "hooks" for special processing</title>
            <para>To maintain maximum flexibility the daemon will check for the existence of several
                (optional) shell scripts that can be provided by the user to take special actions on
                server shutdown, server startup, channel switching etc. The package provides
                templates for all of them that can be tweaked and then stored in the configuration
                directory (by default <filename>/etc/tvpvrd</filename>). The available hooks are
                listed below with a note if they are mandatory or not. To use the hooks they must
                first be renamed by removing the "<filename>*.template</filename>" extension. For
                the majority of the these script the daemon will call them with optional arguments.
                The template code shows how to make use fo these arguments, for example the full
                filename of a video that has just been recorded.</para>

                            shutdown. NFS is notoriously bad in handling a server no longer
                            available and it can cause hangs and freezes in the client when it waits

                                mp4 profile directory. Up to 5 different file lists can be added
                                simultaneous. There is no guarantee that files from all queued file
                                lists will be fairly processed, i.e. one file from the first list,

                                This is completely random. The only thing that is guaranteed is that
                                the video files in each file lists will be processed
