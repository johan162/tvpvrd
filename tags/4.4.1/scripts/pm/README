This directory contains helper system scripts for OpenSuSE to support suspend and hibernation.

10tvpvrd
---------
This is a script that when installed in either /etc/pm/sleep.d (or /usr/lib/pm/sleep.d) sill shut
down tvpvrd at the time of the suspend/hibernate command and start the daemon when the computer
resumes after the suspend/hibernation event.

The reason for doing this is that the drivers for ivtv has to be removed from the kernel before
the suspend operation and reloaded at startup. This puts the HW in the default settings and having
the daemon restart is the easiest way to reinitialize all values.

ivtv.config
------------
This file should really be a part of the ivtv package but isn't. It will force the power management
subsystem (pm-utils et.al) to unload the driver before the suspend operation and then properly
reload it when the system is restarted.

This script should be store in /etc/pm/config.d/ (or /usr/lib/pm/config.d)

The installation will properly install these script in the usr/lib/pm/* location since this is the
peroper place for packages to store there config files. The /etc/pm/* should be used for local
manual modifications.
