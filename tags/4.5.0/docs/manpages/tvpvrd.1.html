                more installed TV-Capture cards and, following a specified schedule, will record
                broadcasted and encoded streams from the capture card to disk. In effect a digital
                version of a programmable VHS. In a similar way as a VCR the daemon also have the
                capability to shutdown and power on the server in time for recordings (see the
                auto-shutdown section below). In the same way as the old-fashioned VHS it has the
                capability to turn off the power of the server and wake it up in time for a
                recording in a fully automated way (by using the BIOS wakeup alarm).</p><p>The original HW MPEG2 encoded videofile (from the capture card) can then be
                optionally transcoded (using <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">ffmpeg</span>(1)</span> ) to a more efficient format by the daemon. The specific details on
                both the initial HW encoder settings as well as the transcoding options are bundled
                in a user configurable 'profile'. The daemon supports the usage of  multiple
                profiles. </p><p>Each recording is done using one (or multiple) profiles. Each recording will
                always have at least one profile, the primary profile. In this way it is possible to
                create multiple transcoded versions of one recording, for example one high quality
                version for viewing on a computer and one low quality versions for viewing on a
                mobile device. By default the distribution includes six profiles 'high', 'normal',
                'low' without transcoding and 'thigh', 'tnormal', 'tlow' with transcoding enabled.
                Additional profiles can easily be added by the user. A profile is specified in the
                traditional ini-file text file format and is stored under the 'profiles' directory
                which is a subdirectory to the settings directory (normally
                    <code class="filename">/etc/tvpvrd</code>). Each setting in the profile is well
                documented in the profiles. </p><p>The recordings specified are stored in a database which is a plain text file in
                XML format using UTF-8 character encoding.</p><p>Recorded and transcoded files are stored in a predefined directory structure. The
                base directory for this directory structure is defined in the configuration file,
                see also the section "Directory Structure" below.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="Arguments"><a name="tvpvrd.options"></a><h2>Arguments</h2><p>The following command line arguments are supported when starting the daemon</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><code class="option">-d</code>, <code class="option">--daemon</code>

                root user. As soon as the server doesn't need root privileges it will switch to run
                as the user specified in the ini-file, by default this is the user
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>tvpvrd</em></span>. This user should for security reasons not be the
                'root' user. This user should be a system user without login shell. Such a user can
                normally be created by running the command '<span class="emphasis"><em>useradd</em></span>'. (If the
                server is installed via the RPM package this user will be automatically
                created).</p><p>Note: If you want to use the automatic shutdown/wakeup functionality the daemon
                must be run as root (since only root has privileges to access the BIOS wakeup
                functionality)</p><pre class="screen">$&gt; useradd -r tvpvrd</pre><p>To start the server as root the simplest way is to just call</p><pre class="screen">$root&gt; tvpvrd</pre><p>In order to stop the server and allow it to do a clean shutdown the SIGHUP (or
                SIGSTOP) signal should be sent to the process running the server (assuming tvpvrd
                has been started as a daemon). The distribution includes two support scripts to help
                with this. </p><p>The first script will be automatically installed in
                    "<code class="filename">/etc/init.d/tvpvrd</code>" and follows the normal guidelines for
                a "<code class="filename">init.d</code>" service start/stopping script according to LSB
                (Linux Standard Base). Using this script to start the server the command</p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/tvpvrd start</pre><p>is given and to stop the server the command</p><pre class="screen">/etc/init.d/tvpvrd stop</pre><p>should be given. The startup script also supports the "restart" and "status"
                options.</p><p>The second script is '<code class="filename">stop-tvpvrd</code>' which will read the server
                process pid from '<code class="filename">/var/run/tvpvrd.pid</code>' and send the SIGHUP
                signal.</p><p>In order to stop the server first switch to root user and then use the
                command</p><pre class="screen">$root&gt; stop-tvpvrd</pre><p>Finally if for some reason you don't want to use any of these scripts it is
                possible to manually kill the daemon process by sending the SIGHUP signal via the
                    '<span class="emphasis"><em>kill</em></span>'command as</p><pre class="screen">$&gt; kill -SIGHUP &lt;pid&gt;</pre><p>where &lt;pid&gt; is the process id of the <span class="emphasis"><em>tvpvrd</em></span> daemon. Use
                'ps xa' to find the pid or if the server was started as root look in the file
                    '<code class="filename">/var/run/tvpvrd.pid</code>' </p><p>When the server is shutdown, depending on the "Kill transcoding flag" (see the
                    <code class="option">-ktf</code> command), any on-going transcodings will be shutdown. Any
                potential ongoing recordings will be aborted and the recordings up to the time the
                recording is shutdown will be left in the '<code class="filename">&lt;data-dir&gt;/vtmp</code>'
                directory and must be removed manually.</p><p>If the server gives the error message : "<span class="emphasis"><em>Server can not be started. See
                    system log</em></span>" then more information about the details of the problem
                can be found in the system log, normally <code class="filename">/var/log/messages</code>. One
                common issue might be a stale lock file (in
                <code class="filename">/var/run/tvpvrd.pid</code>) in case the server is not started from the
                root user. The reason is that in order to write these lock files the server must run
                as a root. Since normally the server only runs as a root at the startup phase (and
                then switches over to the selected user) the lock/pid file cannot be removed. This
                is not a problem if the server is again started as root but if the server is started
                from the command line as a non-root user it will complain that the lock file already
                exists. The solution in this case is to manually remove the lockfile (as
                root).</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="Interfacing with the server"><a name="idp24899584"></a><h2>Interfacing with the server</h2><p>The primary interface to the server is via a TCP/IP connection to the server
                running '<span class="emphasis"><em>tvpvrd</em></span>' via a dedicated port (by default 9300). The
                server is controlled via a simple (but efficient) command language which allows
                manipulation of future recordings and various other administrative tasks. All
                commands are extensively described in the section 'Command language' below. </p><p>The preferred way of interacting with the server on the command level is by using
                the supplied utility shell '<span class="application">tvpsh</span>'. This supports history
                and full command line editing and is recommended over a plain
                    '<span class="application">telnet</span>' connections to the server.</p><p>As an optional way there is also a native basic WEB-interface that allows a
                limited number of commands such as adding of new recording, deleting existing
                recordings, viewing status, showing upcoming recordings etc. The WEB-inerface
                contains enough controls and command to handle most day-to-day needs for a digital
                VCR and it is anticipated that most users should use this interface as there main
                port of accessing the server.</p><p>The WEB-interface must first be enabled in the config-file since it is by default
                disabled. The WEB interface is accessed on port number (port+1) i.e one more than
                the port number specified for the command interface. This means that by default the
                WEB-interface is available on port 9301. The WEB-interface can optionally require a
                separate login as specified in the configuration file. </p><p>To access the WEB interface from a browser simple give the server address and port
                number. For example to access the daemon on the server "<code class="code">localhost</code>" with
                the default port number use URL "<code class="filename">http://localhost:9301</code>". </p><p>The look and feel (themes) of the WEB-interface is entirely controlled by a CSS
                style sheet stored in the configuration directory (usually specified as
                    <code class="filename">/etc</code>). This is the same place as where the configuration
                file is stored. This means it is straightforward to change and adjust the look and
                feel from the default colors and layout in the supplied themes. All that is
                necessary is basic knowledge of CSS stylesheets.</p><p>It is also possible to control some functional aspects uin the WEB-UI such as what
                controls are displayed in the Web UI by adjusting config file settings. Supported
                settings are: </p><p>
                </p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">display_advanced_rec_control</code>, This setting
                            hides/displays two extra controls for how naming of repeated recordings
                            are named.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">web_display_theme</code>, If the theme switching control
                            should be displayed.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">web_autodisplay_transc</code>, If the transcoded
                            information bar should be hidden if there are no ongoing
                            transcodings.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">web_display_qadd</code>, If the section for "Quick
                            Recording", should be displayed in the Web-UI or not.</p></li></ul></div><p>
            </p><p>The WEB interface will also automatically adapt when it detects that a mobile
                phone browser is trying to access the interface to a format more suitable for a
                smaller screen. By necessity this means that only an even smaller subset of the
                WEB-commands are available in the browser on a phone in order to keep the interface
                simple. The detection is based on the header that the browser sends and should
                detect most phones. However, it is possible that some browsers used on mobile phone
                will not be detected as mobile browsers and then the normal WEB interface will be
                used.</p><p>See the section "Connecting to the server" below for more detailed
                examples.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="Automatic shutdown and startup of the server"><a name="idp24915104"></a><h2>Automatic shutdown and startup of the server</h2><p>In the same way as a VCR (or a modern HD recorder) has the capability to shut down
                and power on in time for recording the tvpvrd can do this with the server it is
                running on. The daemon package has two radically different way to do this and
                depending on your preference (and/or HW) either way can be chosen. The server
                supports either the usage of the internal BIOS real time clock using a wakeup alarm
                or running a power management daemon (<span class="command"><strong>tvpowerd</strong></span>) on a separate
                server. If you have a reasonable modern server (say 2005 or newer) it will most
                likely support BIOS wakeup alarm and since that is the easiest method we strongly
                recommend you use that method.</p><div class="refsect2" title="Method 1: Using the BIOS wakeup alarm on the server running the tvpvrd daemon"><a name="idp24917392"></a><h3>Method 1: Using the BIOS wakeup alarm on the server running the tvpvrd
                    daemon</h3><p>To use this method it is first important to recognize that the daemon must be
                    running as user '<code class="code">root</code>' in order to have the privilege to shut down
                    the server. This is also the preferred method.</p><p>To enable this feature it must first be enabled in the configuration file
                    under the section <code class="code">[shutdown]</code> . By default this feature is disabled.
                    There are then some basic parameters that should be checked according to
                    preference. For example the parameter <code class="code">ignore_users</code> will determine
                    if the shutdown should still happen if there are user logged in to the server or
                    not. All the available parameters are fully specified and documented in the
                    default configuration file.</p><p>To make this work the daemon assumes that the RTC (BIOS Real Time Clock)
                    presents an interface on the
                    "<code class="filename">/sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm</code>" that can be used to set the
                    time in seconds since Epoc when the server should wake up if it is powered off.
                    In some BIOS it is also necessary to first enable the wakeup alarm by changing
                    some default setting (check your BIOS documentation).</p><p>In order not to miss the recording the server is woken up a little bit before
                    the actual recording time. By default this is 180 sec which should be enough
                    time for even old servers to fully wake up. This pre-wakeup time is configurable
                    in the configuration file. </p><p>The actual shutdown of the server is done by the
                        "<code class="filename">shutdown.sh</code>" script stored in the configuration
                    directory. In the distribution this is included as a template

                    default the script initiates a complete server shutdown and if that is enough
                    the template can just be copied and renamed. </p><p>If the server is reasonable new it might be possible to do a sleep (or
                    hibernate) instead but in that case we would recommend using the second method
                    of auto-shutdown using the separate "<span class="command"><strong>tvpowerd</strong></span>" as described
                    below. Please note that there are some special precautions that must be taken to
                    use sleep or hibernation mode since the ivtv-driver is not power management
                    aware. So unless absolutely necessary please use the safe and always working
                    method of just doing a complete shutdown.

                    for the case where you rather sleep (or hibernate) the server instead of
                    shutting it down the package gives an alternative auto-shutdown method using the
                        "<span class="command"><strong>tvpowerd</strong></span>" daemon. This is a separate daemon that must be
                    run on a separate server. This daemon will then communicate with the server
                    running the recording daemon and shut the server down and power it on according
                    to the recording schedule. The power on will be done using Wakeup-On-LAN so this
                    must be enabled in the BIOS on the recording server. There is a complete
                    separate manual page describing all the details on how to use this daemon in <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">tvpowerd</span>(1)</span>

                    alarm then method 1 is the preferred way. Even if you have multiple servers
                    available it is still easier to use method 1.  However there is one circumstance
                    where it might be more practically to use the <span class="command"><strong>tvpowerd</strong></span>
                    standalone daemon. For the common case where you have a NFS or SMB file share
                    exposed from the recording server, for example to be able to view the videos on
                    another computer, there are all kinds off issues if the SMB or NFS server is
                    just shut down without the share unmounted. Especially the NFS protocol is
                    notoriously bad in handling a disconnected server without a proper unmount.
                    Running the separate <span class="command"><strong>tvpowerd</strong></span> daemon on the client will allow
                    you to put in the necessary unmount commands in the shutdown script (assuming
                    the tvpowerd is running on the server mounting shares). </p><p>In future releases of <span class="command"><strong>tvpvrd</strong></span> it will be possible to run
                    user selectable scripts on clients to the recording server at the shutdown time.
                    This can then be used to, for example, give the client notification that the
                    recording server is shutting down and then be able to do any necessary unmounts
                    or other cleanup activities.</p><p>In the case where you rather want to suspend to RAM/DISK then it is also
                    necessary to run the separate <span class="command"><strong>tvpowerd</strong></span> daemon. The main
                    reason here is that since the ivtv-drivers that resides in the kernel is not
                    power management aware they must therefore be unloaded before the server is put
                    into hibernation and then reloaded when the server is woken up. This can be (and
                    is) all taken care of in the shutdown scripts for the tvpowerd daemon. However,
                    there is really no practical reason to put the recording server in
                    sleep/hibernation state compare with a full shutdown. The only thing gained is
                    faster startup time which for these use-cases are not really interesting (nor
                    necessary).</p></div></div><div class="refsect1" title="Running as master or slave"><a name="idp24936880"></a><h2>Running as master or slave</h2><p>Normally the daemon will do necessary checks to verify that one or several video
                cards are present in order to startup. If no video cards are found the server will
                print an error message and terminate. However it is still possible to run the daemon
                on a server with no video cards by running the server in <span class="italic">slave</span> mode. This will restrict the functionality of the
                server to only transcoding and status information commands.</p><p>The primary purpose of running the server in slave configuration is to make it

                stream from the capture card to a file.</p><p>The transcoding process refers to the re-coding of the original MPEG2 video stream
                to a more efficient format, usually an MPEG4 container using H.264 video codec (the
                default in the distributed profiles). Depending on the quality settings it is common
                to see reduction in original file size with 75%.</p><p>The transcoding process is very CPU-intensive and with the default settings in the
                distribution the normal profile will require anywhere between roughly 1.5 times the
                original recording length to transcode on a pentium dual core to roughly 0.5 times
                the recording length on a newer i3 or i5 Intel CPU. With a high end Intel multi-core
                i7 CPU and some basic setting the transcoding time can be down to ~0.3 times the
                length of the original recording.</p><p>In order not to make the machine totally unresponsive the ini-file specifies a
                maximum load on the server for a transcoding to start in order not to load the
                server with too many parallel transcoding processes. The transcoding process is also
                run with a 'nice' value of 20 to have the transcoding process interfere as little as
                possible with any interactive use on the server. If the load is too high the
                transcoding processes will be put in a queue waiting for the load to become
                acceptable. Note that the serer will not wait forever and if the load has not
                dropped below the threshold for a certain time (as specified by the
                    <code class="code">max_waiting_time_to_transcode</code> setting in the ini-file) the
                transcoding will be cancelled and the original MPEG2 file left alone.</p><p>When a recording is started a temporary directory will be created under
                    '<code class="filename">&lt;data-dir&gt;/vtmp/vid&lt;n&gt;/</code>' where &lt;n&gt; is the number
                of the video card used. The name of the temporary directory will be the same as the
                base name of the recording. The MPEG2 stream is read from the video card and stored
                in a file in the temporary directory with the same name as the title (converted to
                lower case) with the suffix ".mpg".</p><p>If multiple profiles are specified there exists an ambiguity on what HW MPEG2
                parameters to use in case they are different among the selected profiles. The server
                resolves this by using the HW parameters from the profile with the highest specified
                video bitrate. This is motivated by the fact that using high quality encoder
                settings on a low original bitrate can never give a good result.</p><p>When the recording has stopped the transcoding profile(s) is read and the
                transcoding is started after a check that the server load is not higher than the
                maximum allowed load in order to start a transcoding. If the load is too high the
                transcoding is put in a queue of waiting transcodings that will be started when the
                server load allows the transcoding to start. One transcoding will be made for each
                of the associated profiles of this recording.</p><p>As a special case no transcoding will be made if the '<span class="emphasis"><em>ffmpeg</em></span>'
                profile bitrate is set to 0 Mbps in the profile. In this case only the original
                MPEG2 video file will be kept.</p><p>Once a transcoding has finished the resulting MP4 file will be moved either to the
                directory '<code class="filename">&lt;data-dir&gt;/mp4/&lt;profile&gt;/</code>' with the same file
                basename as the title but with the filename suffix ".mp4"  or directly under
                    <code class="filename">'&lt;data-dir&gt;/mp4/'</code> depending whether or not
                subdirectories should be used for each profile (see setting file).</p><p>When all the transcodings have been done and if the profile defines that the
                original MPEG2 video stream should be kept it is moved to the directory
                    '<code class="filename">&lt;data-dir&gt;/mp2/</code>'. After that the temporary directory
                (and the original MPEG2 file) is deleted.</p><p>Another possibility is to do the recording first and later decide to transcode one
                or several video files. This is done by giving a separate transcode command to the
                server and specify the full file path to the file to be transcoded. In order to make
                this as convenient as possible there are three variants of this. One variant is to
                transcode one video file, the other is to specify a directory where all the files in
                that directory will be transcoded. The final way is to store a number of video file
                names in a text file and use that text file as an input list of the files to
                transcode. See the command description below for the commands "<code class="option">tf</code>",
                    "<code class="option">td</code>" and "<code class="option">tl</code>".</p><p>Note that it is possible to get notify by mail when a transcoding has finished.

                spectrum is a natural resource that divided in internationally standardized fixed
                width channels. A channel is the same as a specified frequency. The distance between
                each assigned frequency is different depending on both the frequency area and the TV
                standard used. This depends on the fact that different TV standard requires
                different bandwidth. This channel division is also different depending on the
                geographic location. </p><p>It is important to realize that these fixed frequencies are assigned according to
                international standards. In each city (and city area) the broadcasting company is
                then responsible for assigning local stations to appropriate frequency channels.
                This is the difference between station and channel names. The channel names are
                standardized names that have short name with 2 to 5 characters, for example 'SE14'.
                Even though the frequency division is standardized the exact channel names are not
                always given with the assigned names. For example a broadcasting company might claim
                (for example on their home page) that the station 'BBC1' in a certain area can be
                found on channel '14' when they actually should have said that the station can be
                found on channel 'SE14' which is the official name of this channel.</p><p>To further complicate matters different countries uses different standardized

                to the correct frequency channel used by the station we want to record. Since it is
                a lot easier to use the station names, for example "BBC1", than the official name on
                the frequency channel, e.g. SE14, the program uses yet another mapping file so it is

                included. Normally your TV provider provides a channel plan for your area.
                Unfortunately, to make things a bit more difficult some broadcasting company is not

                    '<code class="filename">/etc/X11/xawtvrc</code>' or in your home directory

                "Kanal5" when specifying recordings which is a lot easier than to remember that this
                station is on channel "SE11".</p><p>Some cable providers are a bit naughty and does not follow the officially
                allocated channel names and frequencies. To handle this case there is also a
                possibility to specify the frequency directly in the station-channel mapping file.

                (for example <span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">scantv</span>(1)</span>) which will search through a given frequency map and list all
                channels where a broadcasting was found (this is identified as a high enough
                signal-to-noise ratio). For example the SuSE distribution have a TV channel scanning
                setup in the yast2 configuration tool. The result of this channel scan is usually
                stored in a file named '<code class="filename">xawtvrc</code>'. This is normally stored in
                either '<code class="filename">/etc/X11/xawtvrc</code>' or in your home directory, as
                    '<code class="filename">~/.awtvrc</code>'. However the actual station names you want to
                use for the channels must be manually given. </p><p>The somewhat strange name of the map file comes from an ancient TV viewer program
                under X11 which was/(is) called '<span class="application">xawtv</span>'. For historic
                reason this name has stayed.</p><p>While it is possible to use either the station name or the channel name in a
                recording there must be a '<code class="filename">xawtvrc</code>' file in order for the
                server to start properly. If the station file cannot be found an error message will
                be printed and the server will not start.</p><p>The location of this file is normally specified in the ini-file but the location
                can also be overridden with command line argument (<code class="option">-x</code>) when the
                server is started (see Options) which will override the setting in the
                ini-file.</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="Selecting alternative video inputs as source for the encoding"><a name="idp25034640"></a><h2>Selecting alternative video inputs as source for the encoding</h2><p>A video capture card has normally several possible input to the HW MP2 encoder.
                When encoding TV the tuner is usually the selected input. However most cards also
                have one or several external connects that can be used to encode other video
                sources. For example Hauppauge analogue cards have one or more (depending on the
                card) S-Video inputs that could be used as source for the video encoding.</p><p>The first thing to do if one wants to use one of these alternative input sources
                is to determine exactly what input sources the combination of card and low level
                driver supports. This can be done with the help of the command <span class="command"><strong>li</strong></span>
                . This will list all the available input sources for the specified video card. For
                example if your server have a Hauppauge 350 installed as the first card giving the
                command</p><p><span class="command"><strong>li 0</strong></span></p><p>would generate output similar to</p><pre class="screen">Hauppauge WinTV PVR-350
00 :*(tuner) Tuner 1
01 : (camera) S-Video 1
02 : (camera) Composite 1
03 : (camera) S-Video 2
04 : (camera) Composite 2
05 : (camera) Composite 3</pre><p>This is a list of all possible video sources supported by the card. The current
                selected source is shown with an asterix just to the left of the type of
                input.</p><p>In order to use one of these inputs as the source for the recoding instead of the
                standard tuner a special station name is used "<span class="italic">_inpXY</span>". The 'X' should be replaced by the video card to be used
                (starting at 0) and the 'Y' should be replaced by the index for the wanted input
                source. So for example going back to the previous Hauppauge 350 above a meta station
                name of "<code class="code">_inp04</code>" would use the composite 2 input source (assuming the
                card is the first card, i.e. 0).</p><p>In order for the server to know which input belongs to the tuner this is specified
                in the config file with the setting <span class="italic">tuner_input_index</span>, by default this is 0. Since there is only one
                setting this implies that all cards use the same index for the tuner. This is a
                limitation of the current implementation. If you have several cards where the tuner
                is located at different input indexes then the server can only work correctly on one
                card. This is a very minor limitation since the number of users with multiple cards
                with tuners on other indexes than 0 can be assumed to be very small.</p><p>A final example will make this crystal clear. Assume we want to record a CCTV
                camer that is connected to composite input 1 on our Hauppauge 350 card. To
                immediately start recording for 30 min using the default profile we could give the
                command</p><pre class="screen">q _inp02 00:30 cctv_camera_one</pre><p>the command above would immediately start a recording using card 0 and input with
                index 2, i.e.. the "<code class="code">Composite 1</code>" input. The recording will be stored
                with the name "<code class="code">cctv_camera_one.mp4</code>" (assuming the default profile is
                setup to do transcoding to MP4 format).</p><p>There is also an option to handle channel switching on a cable box. This is

                            running the daemon have exported filesystems to allow clients to fetch
                            the videos by either SMB or NFS mounting there will be problem if those
                            filesystems are still mounted if the server initiates an automatic
                            shutdown. NFS is notoriously bad in handling a server no longer
                            available and it can cause hangs and freezes in the client when it waits
                            indefinitely for the server to respond. </p><p>This can be handled by allowing the recording server to execute
                            mounting/unmounting scripts on clients (via ssh). To allow ssh execution
                            without passwords the recording server must be allowed to access a
                            client via ssh and using public keys without passwords. This means that
                            the recording servers public key (<code class="filename">id_rsa.pub</code>) must
                            be stored in the clients "<code class="filename">authorized_keys</code>" file
                            (usually in the home directory under <code class="filename">.ssh/</code>)</p><p>In the shutdown script one has then to add calls to each client to
                            unmount the filesystems and in the startup script one can call the
                            clients to re-mount all the necessary filesystems.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Some video cards require some postprocessing on the MP2 video before

                several seasons. One way of naming each episode in such a series is by giving the
                core series name a suffix of "<code class="literal">SnnEmm</code>" where
                    "<code class="literal">nn</code>" is the season number and "<code class="literal">mm</code>" is the
                episode number. </p><p>Starting with version 4.3.0 <span class="application">tvpvrd</span> make this type of
                naming schema easier with the existing repeating recording command
                    ("<span class="command"><strong>ar</strong></span>"). </p><p>The way to handle this is to first specify that the name mangling for each
                recording in the series should add "<code class="literal">Emm</code>" to the core name. By
                default the episode number starts at "01". This is done by the
                    "<span class="command"><strong>sm</strong></span>" command as "<span class="command"><strong>sm 2</strong></span>". The correct season
                number "<code class="literal">Snn</code>" is manually included when the name of the series is
                given. The default name mangling to be used by the server is also specified in the
                configuration file so if this is already set to "2" then there is no need to give
                this command. By default in the distribution the name mangling is set to add the
                date as a suffix to each recordings name.</p><p>If the recording of the series is started in the middle of the season the starting
                episode number can be specified with the "<span class="command"><strong>ss</strong></span>" command.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Example</strong></span></p><p>To record the second season of a program called "Nature" starting with episode 5
                the following commands would have to be given:</p><p>
                </p><pre class="screen">sm 2
ss 5
ar w 20 tv1 tue 21:00 21:56 Nature S02</pre><p>
            </p><p>This will in the end create recordings that are named
                "Nature_S02E05","Nature_S02E06", and so on.</p><p>These types of recording can also be done from the Web-interface (perhaps even
                easier since there is no need to remember the exact command sequence).</p></div><div class="refsect1" title="Commands (in alphabetic order)"><a name="idp25124448"></a><h2>Commands (in alphabetic order)</h2><p>The following is a list and detailed explanation of the commands that are
