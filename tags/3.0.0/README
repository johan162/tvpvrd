README FILE FOR PACKAGE : 'TVPVRD'
'tvpvrd' = TV Personal Video Recorder Daemon
$Id$
=======================================================================================
This package contains two installable daemons, tvpvrd and tvpowerd.

The package will install tvpvrd as explained below. The other daemon cannot be
automatically installed since this is an optional monitoring daemon that is
supposed to be running on a physically separate server. The purpose of the
optional tvpowerd daemon is to provide an alternative way of monitoring 
the power on/off of the recording server compared with the built-in method
of automatic shut-down/power-on of the daemon

See manpages for much more detailed information (docs/manpages/) on when
to use the alternative method.

For installations instructions see the file INSTALL

After installation you should check the configuration file 'tvpvrd.conf' so
that it corresponds to your server setup. It is especially important that the
following settings are correct and matching your installation.

    * datadir                   - Where the recorded files are stored. 
    * video_device_basename     - The device basename for the capture device,
                                  normally '/dev/video'. The first device is
                                  then named '/dev/video0'
    * username                  - Make sure you have user with the specified
                                  user name
    * max_video                 - This must be less or equal to the actual number 
                                  of video cards you have installed

Some notes on where to store the data
-------------------------------------

The Linux File Hierarchy standard suggests that variable program data is
stored under the '/var' directory. However, for this application this might
not be the optimal choice. The main reason is that this application has the
potential to make use of a *lot* of disk space. In many standard installations
it is not uncommon to keep the root directory and the '/var' directory in a
partition with a size of ~10GB even if the disk itself is a  1TB. The
remaining data is usually allocated to '/home'

Since the disk requirements for this application is potentiall so huge we
suggest that a separate partition of at least 20GB is used. In the default
configuration file this partition is assumed to be mounted at '/data/pvr'

What is 'tvpvrd'?
-----------------
The purpose of this program is to act as a digital video recorder
where it is possible to schedule, record and transcode (with the help
pf ffmpeg) TV analogue broadcasts.

The pre-requisite to be able to do this is that the computer
running this software has a TV capture card installed capable
of producing an MPEG2 stream. Example of such cards are, 

   - Hauppauge 350
   - Hauppauge 150

The program will normally run as a daemon in the system and
should be started when the system is booted. 

The server is interfaced through a TCP/IP port (by default 9300)
using a command language. It is also posible to interface the dameon
and a subset of its function through the built-in WEB-server/interface.
By default the WEB-interface is disabled and must first be enabled
in the configuration file (normally /etc/tvpvrd/tvpvrd.conf).

Example session:

(Note: The example assumes that password is not enabled.)

The following example will use 'telnet' to open a communication
channel to the server and schedule a recroding between 19:00 and
20:45 tommorrow (relative to todays date)

$>telnet localhost 9300
Connected to 192.168.0.21.
Escape character is '^]'.
!TVPVRD!
Welcome to tvpvrd-2.1.2beta  [Server] (build:20101211.46)
You are user number 1 out of 4 allowed.
Type 'exit' to disconnect.
Type 'h' to list available commands.
Connection will be closed after 30 min of inactivity.

a bbc1 tomorrow 19:00 20:45 World in focus
[#032|bbc1    |2009-12-28|19:00|20:45|World in focus          |@normal]
exit
Goodbye.
Connection closed by foreign host.

- The first line 'telnet localhost 9300' assumes that the server is
  running on the local machine. If it were running on another machine you would
  have to sue the proper IP-number. By default the port is '9300' that we should
  connect to.

- Then some information from the server is shown (your version number and
  build will most likely be different)

- The next user entered line gives the 'add' command to schedule a new recording.
  A recording is specifed by the station name, date, time and name.
  Since each recording can also be transcoded (from the original MP2 format to
  a more efficient MP4 formst using ffmpeg) the profile to use for this
  transcoding is by default the 'normal' profile. This profile determines the
  size and quality of the resulting video file.

      Note: There are many possible ways to schedule a recording in order to make
      it as easy as possible. The following are some examples of recognized formats

      a bbc2 19 News at 19
            - Will start recording today at 19:00 on station 'bbc2' using the default 
              duration (0:59) and will give title 'New at 19' as the name of the recording.
              Note: If the time is already past 19 the recording will automatically 
              be scheduled for tomorrow.

      a bbc2 19:00 19:30 Short news
            - Start recording today at 19:00 on station 'bbc2' and stop at 19:30
              Note: If the time is already past 19 the recording will automatically 
              be scheduled for tomorrow.

      a bbc2 tomorrow 18 Wheather
            - Will start the recording for the default duration tomorrow at 18 and 
              give the recording the name 'Wheather'

      a bbc2 Thu 21:00 22:50 The Movie
            - Will schedule the recording to start at the next Thursday during the 
              given time and title

      a channel3 2010-01-22 20:00 23:00 The Evening
            - Will schedule a recording on the 22 january during the specified time 
              and title Note: Dates are given in the format 'year-month-day'

      To start a recording immediately the 'q' (for 'quick recording') can be used.

      q tv4 0:45 The rest of the movie
            - Will start a recording immediately with 45 min duration and give it 
              the title "The rest of the Movie"

      The documentation (use man tvpvrd) gives more details on how to specify 
recurrent recordings as well as specifying what transcoding profile to use for a 
specific recording.

- The third line is echoed back from the server as a confirmation that the
  recording has been accepted and will be perfoemed at the specified time.
  The fields are self explanatory (teh first field is a unique seqeunce number
  that the server have assigned to this recording.

- Finally we give the 'exit' command which will cause the server to
  break the telnet connection.
  

Please note that unlike a video recorder the computer must be fully powered on in 
order to be able to start recordings.  If the computer is turned off or in 
sleep/hibernation mode the recording will not start. In order to save energy the
package includes an additional daemon "tvpowerd". This daaemon is supposed to run
on a separate server from the recording server. This daemon will automatically
shut down and power on the recording server to match its recording schedule. You
can find out more details about how this is setup by reading the documentation 
(see doc/ directory).

    SIDENOTE: There is simply no way for the program
    to kickstart the copmputer when it is not running. The only
    way this could be done is by setting the alarm in the bios
    to have the computer wake at a specified time. Unfortunately there
    is no standard interface for the program to interact with the BIOS
    power management as far as I know so this is not really possible.
    Hence, the need to run an external daemon.
