v2.0.0
------

This release has a completely reworked build and configuration script setup.
The configuration is now a first class citizen of the autotools country.

This means that it will build and install itself in many more distributions.

The packages is known to work out of the box on

- OpenSuSE 11.1 and 11.3 (not tested on 11.2)
 -Ubuntu 10.10
- Fedora 13
- Debian Lenny as well as Debian Sid

In addition this release includes an optional companion daemon 'tvpowerd'. This daeomon
is supposed to run on a different server than the recording server. When enabled it will
manage the power of the recording daemon and turn it off and on according to the scheduled
recordings. This will avoid the recording server running when no recording (or transcoding
is taking place). In order for this to work the recording server must support Wake-On-Lan
fot the managing server to be able to turn the power on.

The power daemon can be found under 'src/tvpowerd'. Since it is supposed to be installed
on a different server than the recording daemon it will not be installed with the
make install command. Instead copy the distribution package to the server where you want to
run the power daemon, configure and compile and the run the 'install.sh' script as root.
(The install.sh is found in the tvpowerd directory)
