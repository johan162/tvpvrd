$Id$

This directory contains a very basic shell program which connects 
to the tvpvrd daemon using the TCP/IP port specified in the config 
file for tvpvrd.

This is alternative way to connect and issue commands to the daemon
than to connect using telnet. It is also more convenient since this
supports history and command line editing.

This is the preferred way to connect to the daemon when not using
the Web-interface.

An alternative way of using this shell is to use the shell as a
login shell for a new user.

In that way it is possible to connect to the daemon by logging in to
the server  using for example ssh, as the user which has this shell
as the login shell.

The password handling will then be controlled by the normal Unix password 
as specified in /etc/passwd (or shadow passwords if that is used).

See INSTALL for more details on how to configure the shell as the login
shell for a user.
